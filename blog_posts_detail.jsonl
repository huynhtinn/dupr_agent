That‚Äôs the magic of the flick shot in pickleball.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIt‚Äôs fast.\n\n‚Äç\nIt‚Äôs sneaky.\n\n‚Äç\nAnd when you hit it right, it can completely flip a rally in your favor.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhether you‚Äôre chasing a higher DUPR rating or just want to add some spice to your game, the flick is one of those ‚Äúmust-have‚Äù shots for competitive and rec play alike.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLet‚Äôs break it down.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat‚Äôs a Flick in Pickleball?\n\n‚Äç\n\nThink of a flick as a surprise attack from right up at the kitchen line. You‚Äôre in a soft dink rally, looking all calm and controlled‚Ä¶ then suddenly, with a quick low-to-high wrist snap, you send the ball speeding past your opponent.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIt works because they‚Äôre expecting another soft shot, not a sudden burst of pace. Even better, you can use it to attack balls below net height (something most players won‚Äôt see coming).\n\n‚Äç\n\nPro Player Bobbi Oshiro Hitting a Backhand Flick Shot\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhen to Use the Flick Shot\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe flick isn‚Äôt something you blast out every other ball. It works best when it‚Äôs unexpected. Here‚Äôs when to pull it out:\n\n‚Äç\n\nYou‚Äôre locked in a slow dink rally at the net and want to change gears.\n\n\nYour opponent is creeping in and getting a little too comfortable.\n\n\nYou see an open space and want to catch them flat-footed.\n\n\n\nPro tip: The more patient you are before you flick, the more likely you are to land the point.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow to Hit a Flick in Pickleball - Tips by Pro Player Bobbi Oshiro\n\n‚Äç\n\nStart in a strong, balanced stance\nStay low, knees bent, paddle out front, feet wide. This keeps you ready for anything, flick or dink.\n\n\nUse a continental grip\nSame grip you‚Äôd use for a backhand; it keeps your shot looking identical to a dink until the last second.\n\n\nGo low-to-high\nKeep your paddle down, elbow up, and lift through the ball. This motion sets up your speed and spin.\n\n\nSnap the wrist at the last moment\nThis is the secret sauce. That quick snap is what makes the ball jump off your paddle faster than your opponent expects. Think of the motion as throwing a frisbee.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nCommon Flick Fails (and How to Avoid Them)\n\n‚Äç\n\nBad timing: Don‚Äôt flick every ball. Wait for one that‚Äôs attackable and when you‚Äôve got space to hit into.\n\n\nToo much heat : Yes, it‚Äôs tempting to rip it, but if you overhit, you‚Äôll send it long or straight into the net.\n\n\nKitchen foot faults: No volleying stepping into the kitchen. Rules are rules.\nToo much follow-through or overextending after the shot: Players tend to follow through too much after hitting the shot. Keep the swing quick and short so you are ready for the counter by your opponents.\n\n\n\n‚Äç\n\nThink you know the pickleball rules? Read this article and see if you‚Äôre one of the 90% of players getting these wrong.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy You Should Add It to Your Game\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe flick isn‚Äôt just a ‚Äúcool trick shot.‚Äù It‚Äôs a legit strategy tool that:\n\n‚Äç\n\nForces errors from your opponents.\n\nMakes you unpredictable in dink rallies.\n\nHelps you take control of a point on your terms.\nTakes time away from your opponents by hitting the ball early and out of the air.\n\n\n\nSo whether you‚Äôre grinding for a higher pickleball rating, chasing your next tournament win, or just looking to dominate those tight net battles, the flick is worth the reps.\n\n‚Äç\n\nNext time you‚Äôre on the court, set up some dink rallies with a buddy and practice sneaking in that flick. Use it sparingly, disguise it well, and watch your opponents start questioning every shot you take.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWant more ways to sharpen your game?

The serving team must let your return bounce, which means you have a perfect opportunity to set the tone for the rally.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPros have shared serving tips to minimize that edge, but when you are returning, choosing where and how you place the ball can make all the difference. A smart return can put you or your team on offense immediately.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy Depth Beats Speed\n\n‚Äç\n\nMany players think a hard, low return is best, but that‚Äôs not always the case. Because the serving team must wait for the bounce, your priority should be pushing them back. A deep return:\n\n‚Äç\n\nGives you more time to get to the kitchen line.\n\n\nForces opponents to hit their third shot from farther back.\n\n\nReduces their ability to hit sharp angles.\n\n\n\nIn short: depth over speed.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nStaksrud‚Äôs Pro Perspective\n\n‚Äç\n\nHere‚Äôs how World #1 Federico Staksrud approaches his returns:\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúFor the return, I focus on depth and pace, usually targeting the middle to limit angles and set up my next shot.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nBy aiming deep to the middle, you:\n\n‚Äç\n\nForce opponents into awkward positioning.\n\n\nTake away the sidelines and angles.\n\n\nGive your partner time to move forward with you.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow to Hit Deep, Effective Returns\n\n‚Äç\n\nHitting deep consistently takes more than just swinging harder. Here are a few tips:\n\n‚Äç\n\nLoosen Your Grip:¬† A softer grip helps control depth without overhitting.\n\n\nAim Higher Over the Net: More clearance ensures the ball lands deep instead of into the net.\n\n\nUse Your Legs: Bend and push through the shot for added lift and control.\n\n\nTarget the Middle: Limits angles and forces confusion between opponents.\n\n\nFollow Your Shot In: Use the extra time you‚Äôve created to get to the kitchen line.\n\n\nThe Takeaway\n\n‚Äç\n\nDepth + smart placement = control of the rally.\n\n\nBy focusing on deep returns to the middle, you limit your opponents‚Äô options and set up your team for success. As former collegiate pickleball player David Bieger.said after beating Tyson McGuffin at the PPA Event, ‚Äúmake them beat you, don‚Äôt give them freebies.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nCurious how Bieber took down McGuffin?

In an exclusive interview with DUPR, Ruth Rosenquist, board member of the Global Pickleball Federation and longtime friend of Barney McCallum (one of the sport‚Äôs original creators), shared how it all began.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe sport wasn‚Äôt born in stadiums or clubs, but on a simple driveway in Bainbridge Island, Washington. In 1965, three dads named Joel Pritchard, Bob Bell, and Barney McCallum were trying to do what so many parents did before them:¬† keep their kids entertained. They grabbed some equipment, marked up a court on their driveway, and made up a new game on the spot. What began as a quick backyard activity would eventually become a global phenomenon.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy Is It Called ‚ÄúPickleball‚Äù?\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor decades, the story circulated that the game was named after the Pritchard family dog, ‚ÄúPickles.‚Äù While fun, that story isn‚Äôt quite true. Pickles the dog wasn‚Äôt even born when the game was invented.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"The actual inspiration came from the term ‚Äòpickle boat,‚Äô which is a rowing crew made up of leftover oarsmen from other boats,\" Ruth explained. \"One of the inventors‚Äô wives said the sport was similar, pulling pieces from other games like tennis, badminton, and ping pong, and combining them into something new. And just like that, pickleball was born.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nBuilding the Game, One Paddle at a Time\n\n‚Äç\n\nBarney McCallum, one of the original trio, was a builder at heart. He went into his woodshop and built the first pickleball paddle by hand, helping the sport establish its unique playing style from day one. McCallum even created key features of the game we still use today, like the no-volley zone (the ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù), ensuring rallies stayed fun and accessible for players of all ages.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFrom Driveway Hobby to National Obsession\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor decades, pickleball grew quietly, mostly spread by word-of-mouth among friends and neighbors. Players built their own courts and found whatever paddles they could get their hands on. In the early 1990s, people like Ruth were traveling 30 miles just to find a place to play.\n\n‚Äç\n\nSource: DUPR\n\n‚Äç\n\nBy 2013, Ruth was pushing hard to get the sport into the national spotlight. One of her early wins was convincing NBC Nightly News to run its first-ever pickleball story, coining the now-famous label: ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Fastest Growing Sport.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nA Moment of Laughter and a Glimpse of the Future\n\n‚Äç\n\nRuth recalled a conversation with Barney McCallum, who laughed for five minutes straight when she suggested pickleball could one day make money. At the time, it was hard to imagine pickleball being anything more than a niche backyard pastime. But today, it‚Äôs an industry worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with professional tours, major brand sponsorships, and global reach.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nA new report from Market.us (April 2025) projects the global pickleball market to reach USD 9.1 billion by 2034, up from USD 2.2 billion in 2024. This reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.3% from 2025 to 2034, underscoring the sport‚Äôs accelerating popularity and expanding economic impact worldwide.\n\n‚Äç\n\n60 Years Later: A Global Sport\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat started with three dads, some bored kids, and a handmade paddle is now a worldwide movement made up of both amateur and professional players. There are DUPR players in over 160 countries, with pickleball being on track to seek recognition by the International Olympic Committee. Pickleball is breaking barriers, connecting people of all ages, and, as Ruth says, ‚Äúbringing joy to people‚Äôs lives everywhere it goes.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis year marks Pickleball‚Äôs 60th anniversary, a milestone worth celebrating, not just for how far it‚Äôs come, but for the spirit in which it started: simple, inclusive, and focused on fun.\n\n‚Äç\n\nInterested in learning more about the sport and how to raise your pickleball ratings?

Traditionally, points could only be earned by the serving team, making strategy and patience critical. But as the sport grows, rally scoring has gained popularity for its faster pace and simpler structure.\n\n‚Äç\n\nSo, what‚Äôs the difference? And how does it affect DUPR ratings? Let‚Äôs break it down.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTraditional Scoring: The Original Pickleball Formula\n\n‚Äç\n\nIn traditional pickleball scoring for doubles:\n\n‚Äç\n\nOnly the serving team scores points.\n\n\nThe receiving team can win the rally but only earns the right to force the ball to the second server or get the ball back to serve next.\n\n\nBoth players on the serving team get an opportunity to serve before a sideout occurs.\n\n\nThe score is announced with three numbers (e.g., 7-5-1): serving team‚Äôs score, receiving team‚Äôs score, and whether it‚Äôs the first or second server.\n\n\nPartners rotate sides only if they score a point while serving.\n\n\n\nGames are typically played to 11 points, win by 2. To learn more about serving rules in pickleball, check out this blog.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nRally Scoring: Speeding the Game\n\n‚Äç\n\nRally scoring changes one key rule: a point is awarded on every rally, regardless of who served.\n\n‚Äç\n\nScoring is simplified to two numbers (e.g., 7-6), making it easier for new players and spectators to follow.\n\n\nPlayers stay on their designated sides instead of rotating based on points won.\n\n\nMatches typically play to 21 points, still win by 2, to balance the faster pace.\n\n\nHow Does Rally Scoring Affect Your DUPR Rating?\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR‚Äôs algorithm factors in rally scoring. Because rally scoring matches tend to be tighter, the favorite‚Äôs expected point percentage is slightly lower compared to traditional scoring. DUPR‚Äôs predictions and post-match updates are based on real data from both formats, so whether you play traditional or rally scoring, your DUPR rating remains fair and accurate.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTo learn more about DUPR‚Äôs algorithm, check out DUPR‚Äôs How It Works Page.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nBottom Line\n\n‚Äç\n\nBoth scoring systems bring unique elements to the game:\n\n‚Äç\n\nTraditional scoring rewards patience, holding serve, and strategic sideouts.\n\n\nRally scoring increases pace, simplifies scoring, and speeds up the game.\n\n\n\nWhich one do you prefer? Either way, DUPR‚Äôs rating system adjusts for both."}

But here‚Äôs the truth: losing the weight is only half the battle; keeping it off is the real challenge.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis is where reverse dieting comes in. By gradually increasing calories back to maintenance instead of jumping straight into your old eating habits, you can protect your results, rebuild your metabolism, and avoid regaining the weight you worked so hard to lose.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIn this guide, we‚Äôll break down exactly how reverse dieting works, why it‚Äôs so effective, and how to transition from fat loss to long-term maintenance, without sacrificing your pickleball performance or your lifestyle.\n\n‚Äç\n\nReverse Dieting: Protecting Your Results\n\n‚Äç\n\nOnce you achieve your fat loss goal, the work isn't over. Reverse dieting‚Äîgradually increasing calories back to maintenance level‚Äîprevents weight regain.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy Reverse Dieting Works\n\n‚Äç\n\nExtended calorie restriction leads to metabolic adaptation, where your body becomes more efficient and burns fewer calories. Reverse dieting helps restore metabolic rate while maintaining your new body composition.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Process\nIncrease calories gradually: Add 50-100 calories per week\nMonitor weight and measurements: Allow 1-2 weeks between increases\nPrioritize protein: Maintain high protein intake throughout\nResume maintenance: Reach your new maintenance level over 4-8 weeks\n\n‚Äç\n\nAction Step: Plan your reverse diet before you finish your fat loss phase, and be patient with the process.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBuilding a Sustainable Mindset\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe most sophisticated nutrition and training plan fails without the right mindset.

It‚Äôs not just for bodybuilders; it‚Äôs essential for anyone who wants to get leaner, stronger, and recover faster after long matches or intense training sessions.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIn Tip #1, we talked about focusing on body composition instead of just the number on the scale. Now it‚Äôs time to talk about what you‚Äôre eating, starting with protein.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy? Because when you‚Äôre in a calorie deficit, your body isn‚Äôt just losing fat ; it can also start breaking down muscle. That‚Äôs where protein steps in: it helps preserve your lean muscle, keeps you full longer, and even burns more calories during digestion.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIn this post, we‚Äôll break down exactly how much protein you need, when to eat it, the best sources (yes, plant-based too!), and how to balance it with carbs and fats for max pickleball performance.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLet‚Äôs dive in.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPrioritizing Protein for Performance and Fat Loss\n\n‚Äç\n\nProtein serves multiple crucial functions during fat loss that extend far beyond muscle building:\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Science Behind Protein's Power\n\n‚Äç\n\nThermic Effect: Protein requires 20-30% of its calories to digest, compared to 5-10% for carbs and 0-5% for fats\nSatiety: High-protein meals increase fullness hormones (GLP-1, PYY) while reducing the hunger hormone (ghrelin)\nMuscle Preservation: Adequate protein intake maintains lean mass during calorie restriction\nRecovery: Supports tissue repair after intense pickleball sessions\n\n‚Äç\n\nOptimal Protein Intake\n\n‚Äç\n\nBetween 1.6 and 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight is recommended daily for active individuals in a calorie deficit. For a 70kg (154lb) player, this translates to 110-155 grams per day.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHigh-Quality Sources:\n\nLean meats (chicken, turkey, lean beef)\nFish and seafood\nEggs and egg whites\nDairy products (Greek yogurt, cottage cheese)\nPlant-based options (tofu, tempeh, legumes, protein powders)\n\n‚Äç\n\nTiming Strategy: Distribute protein throughout the day, aiming for 25-30 grams per meal to support muscle protein synthesis.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAction Step: Plan each meal around a protein source first, then add carbohydrates and fats to complete the nutritional profile.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nBalancing Carbohydrates and Fats for Performance\n\n‚Äç\n\nContrary to popular diet trends, you don't need to eliminate entire macronutrient groups to lose fat effectively. Your body thrives on balanced nutrition that supports both fat loss and athletic performance.\n\n‚Äç\n\nCarbohydrates: Your Performance Fuel\n\n‚Äç\n\nCarbohydrates are your muscles' preferred energy source, especially during high-intensity pickleball rallies. The key is choosing quality sources and timing intake appropriately.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBest Choices:\n\nWhole grains (oats, quinoa, brown rice)\nFruits (especially berries, apples, bananas)\nStarchy vegetables (sweet potatoes, squash)\nLegumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas)\n\n‚Äç\n\nTiming Tip: Consume carbohydrates around your training sessions to fuel performance and support recovery.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHealthy Fats: Essential for Hormones and Health\n\n‚Äç\n\nDietary fat supports hormone production, nutrient absorption, and joint health‚Äîall crucial for pickleball players.\n\n‚Äç\n\nQuality Sources:\n\nAvocados and olives\nNuts and seeds\nOlive oil and avocado oil\nFatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines)\n\n‚Äç\n\nGeneral Guidelines:\n\n20-35% of total calories from fat\nEmphasize monounsaturated and omega-3 fatty acids\nLimit processed and trans fats\n\n‚Äç\n\nAction Step: Initially, use a food tracking app to understand your macronutrient balance, then transition to intuitive eating as you develop better habits.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIt's time to boost your pickleball ratings!

Discover why scale weight doesn‚Äôt tell the whole story. In this first tip of our science-based weight loss guide for pickleball players, learn how to shift your focus to body composition for lasting results.", "url": "https://www.dupr.com/post/how-to-lose-weight-playing-pickleball-tip-2-creating-a-sustainable-calorie-deficit", "content": "The Pickleball Player's Science-Based Guide to Sustainable Weight Loss\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleball is one of the most enjoyable and effective ways to stay active; but if your goal is to lose body fat, there‚Äôs one key truth you can‚Äôt ignore: playing alone isn‚Äôt enough. Without the right nutrition strategy, you might be undoing all your hard work on the court without even realizing it.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe good news? You don‚Äôt have to starve yourself or cut out the foods you love. You just need a sustainable calorie deficit; and we‚Äôre here to show you how to do it the right way.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIn Tip #1, we focused on improving body composition instead of obsessing over the number on the scale. Now, it‚Äôs time to break down the balance between how many calories you‚Äôre consuming vs. how many you‚Äôre burning.\n\n‚Äç\n\nCreating a Sustainable Calorie Deficit\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe fundamental principle of fat loss remains unchanged: you must burn more calories than you consume. However, the execution requires nuance and patience, not extreme restriction.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nCalculate Your Needs Accurately\n\nUse AIM7‚Äôs comprehensive weight loss calculator that factors in your age, height, current weight, body composition, and activity level (including pickleball sessions). This gives you a baseline for creating a modest deficit.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTarget Range: Aim for 0.5 to 2 pounds of fat loss per week. This rate:\n\nPreserves muscle mass and performance\nMaintains energy for training and matches\nReduces metabolic adaptation\nIncreases long-term adherence\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Deficit Sweet Spot\n\n‚Äç\n\nA modest daily deficit of 300-500 calories typically produces optimal results. Larger deficits may seem appealing, but often lead to:\n\nMuscle loss alongside fat loss\nDecreased performance and recovery\nIncreased hunger and cravings\nHigher likelihood of regaining weight\n\n‚Äç\n\nAction Step: Track your intake for one week without making any changes to establish your baseline, then create a modest deficit from there.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nFat loss doesn't have to mean cutting out all your favorite foods or feeling exhausted on the court. With the right numbers in place, and a little patience, you can lose fat while still performing your best in pickleball.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nWant help staying on track? Download the AIM7 app to calculate your needs, monitor your progress, and avoid guesswork.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nAnd if you're wondering what to eat to support this process, don‚Äôt miss Tip #3: Prioritizing Protein; it may just change the way you fuel forever.\n\n‚Äç\n\nMedical Disclaimer\n\nThe information provided in this blog is for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

Monster Athlete Juniors is building the next generation of pickleball players by blending high-level training, structured competition, and DUPR ratings into a program that rivals the established models of youth volleyball and soccer.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFrom its humble beginnings with just 40 kids, Monster Athlete Juniors has grown to over 200 players and is on track to hit 300 this fall. The secret? A proven structure, a commitment to player development, and a belief that kids deserve the same opportunities to excel in pickleball as they do in other sports.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFrom Volleyball to Pickleball: A Proven Model\n\n‚Äç\n\nHoward Vernick, founder of Monster Athlete Juniors, spent over 30 years coaching club and high school volleyball. When he moved to Arizona, one of the fastest-growing states for pickleball, he noticed a major gap: there were no structured pickleball training programs for kids, like those long established in volleyball or soccer.\n\n‚Äç\n\nSo, he created it.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúIf volleyball, soccer, and basketball have developmental pipelines, why not pickleball?‚Äù Vernick explained.\n\n‚Äç\n\nInitially, Monster Athlete Juniors offered both volleyball and pickleball, but the program soon focused entirely on pickleball for athletes ages 8‚Äì17. With partners and coaches experienced in both sports and a trademarked program name, Monster Athlete Juniors built a system from scratch that mirrored the proven success of club volleyball models: structured divisions, seasonal schedules, and tournament play.\n\n‚Äç\n\nA Division for Every Junior Player\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe club has three core divisions:\n\n‚Äç\n\nDevelopmental:¬† Beginner players new to the game (8-week sessions).\n\n\nCompetitive: Intermediate players ready to commit to structured training (12-week sessions).\n\n\nHigh Performance: Players near or above 3.5 DUPR ratings aiming for 4.0 and higher (12-week sessions).\n\n\n\nEach team trains twice a week under dedicated coaches, with developmental teams practicing one hour per session and advanced teams training two hours. The curriculum combines singles, doubles, and even MLP-style team formats, ensuring players learn all aspects of competitive pickleball.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTournaments That Build Players and Grow the Sport\n\n‚Äç\n\nEach 12-week season includes at least three tournaments, mixing indoor and outdoor venues, singles, doubles, and team events. These pickleball tournaments consistently draw 100+ junior competitors, a rare feat in youth pickleball.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAnd the competition isn‚Äôt limited to just members. About 30% of tournament players come from outside the club, providing Monster athletes exposure to new opponents and styles of play, and giving families an exciting look at what competitive youth pickleball can be.\n\n‚Äç\n\nMonster Athlete Juniors also offers ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù tournament packages for players who want to test themselves at higher levels like PPA and NJP events within driving distance of Arizona. This model provides a clear competitive pathway, something few junior programs in the country currently offer.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe DUPR Advantage\n\n‚Äç\n\nOne of Monster Athlete Juniors‚Äô smartest moves was adopting DUPR ratings early.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúWe realized we needed a consistent way to evaluate kids,‚Äù Vernick said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not recreational; we‚Äôre competitive. DUPR gives kids a way to measure where they are and where they want to go.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR helps the club with:\n\n‚Äç\n\nFair matchups by placing players in appropriate divisions and seeding tournaments accurately;\n\n\nRecruitment by using DUPR‚Äôs search and messaging tools to find and connect with top junior talent;\n\n\nShowcasing talent by highlighting players achieving 4.0+ ratings to inspire others and attract families who want serious development.\n\n\n\nIt also helps parents understand the difference between perceived skill and verified performance:\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúSome parents say, ‚ÄòMy kid‚Äôs a 3.5 because a coach told me so,‚Äô‚Äù Vernick explained. ‚ÄúBut DUPR gives an unbiased, data-driven rating based on actual match results. That clarity is huge for families.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nPartnerships and Expansion\n\n‚Äç\n\nMonster Athlete Juniors is already building relationships with universities like Grand Canyon University and Arizona State University, providing clinics and connecting youth players to collegiate pickleball opportunities. The program also has its eyes on charter schools, high school club programs, and long-term integration with scholastic athletics.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWith plans to expand into Tucson, Flagstaff, California, Nevada, Utah, Texas, and even Naples, Florida, Monster Athlete Juniors is positioning itself as the national model for youth pickleball. Franchising and satellite clubs are on the horizon, bringing structure and opportunity to even more kids.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Future of Youth Pickleball\n\n‚Äç\n\nMonster Athlete Juniors has cracked the code on how to grow youth pickleball:\n\nStructured divisions and seasonal schedules\n\n\nFrequent tournaments with verified DUPR ratings\n\n\nStrong developmental and high-performance pathways\n\n\n\nFor other club directors and leaders, Monster Athlete Juniors offers a blueprint for building sustainable youth programs that keep kids engaged and push the sport forward.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre preparing kids for competition, building community, and creating future pickleball athletes,‚Äù Vernick said.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe result? A youth program that‚Äôs not just filling courts, but shaping the future of the sport.\n\n‚Äç"}

Zack shared how the FAU squad rose to the challenge under pressure, and what lessons they're bringing back to collegiate pickleball this fall.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an experience like no other.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor Zack, the opportunity to compete at the professional level was more than just a career milestone; it was validation to continue his journey.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"I‚Äôm so glad I can continue to play and represent my school in a sport that‚Äôs growing exponentially, especially at the college level,‚Äù Zack said.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nPressure and Performance: Lessons from MLP\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe FAU team went head-to-head with challenger squad Florida Smash, ultimately falling 1‚Äì3 in the overall matches, with Zack's match being the last one of the four. When asked if he felt pressure to prove himself, Zack admitted:\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúI did put a lot of pressure on myself at the MLP event, which is unfortunate because it prevented me from giving my best possible performance. I usually try to go into events with no expectations, which helps relieve pressure, but I failed to do that at MLP.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nMany athletes can relate to this kind of moment. It's a true ‚Äúmake or break‚Äù test when stepping onto the professional stage for the first time. Zack‚Äôs reflection on how he handled the pressure reveals a strong sense of self-awareness and personal growth under high-stakes conditions.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe mental game plays a major role, and often, it‚Äôs the mindset that makes the difference against the opposing team. Find out more about how to build mental strength on the pickleball court!\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nFrom Campus Courts to the Biggest Stage\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe speed and intensity of the MLP environment surprised even a player as seasoned as Zack.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúThe level at MLP is a lot different than college pickleball. I practice with top-level players, so that part wasn‚Äôt new, but the pressure changed everything. The game at MLP is much faster and more relentless. In college, players have to slow things down because they can‚Äôt create the same level of offense.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nOnce the excitement, hype, and atmosphere of the big leagues faded, Zack finally had time to reflect, and a powerful realization hit him on the flight home.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúThe second I took my seat on the plane going back home, I thought, ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt ever let this [the pressure and overthinking] happen to me again.‚Äô I learned a lot from that tournament, and I‚Äôll carry those lessons with me in everything I do on and off the court.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nLooking Ahead to the Fall Season\n\n‚Äç\n\nZack believes the MLP experience won‚Äôt just shape him; it‚Äôll elevate the entire FAU team.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúThis experience will absolutely help our college team this fall. I think we‚Äôre all going into the season with a better attitude and a deeper understanding of what it takes mentally to perform in big situations like these.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nAdvice for Aspiring College-to-Pro Players\n\n‚Äç\n\nZack‚Äôs advice to other college players dreaming of going pro? Stay true to yourself.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúBecome the best player you can be, not the best version of someone else. Know your strengths and weaknesses. Maximize what you're good at and minimize your weak spots. Trying to copy someone else‚Äôs game actually hurts your own. Watch and learn from the pros, but don‚Äôt try to be them.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nZack Card‚Äôs journey is a reminder that success isn‚Äôt just about talent; it‚Äôs about growth, self-awareness, and learning to rise under pressure. As pickleball continues its rapid rise at the collegiate level, athletes like Zack are showing the world what the next generation of competitors looks like: passionate, focused, and ready to evolve. Keep up with Zack‚Äôs journey at the FAU Pickleball team this fall season!"}

While it‚Äôs not about overpowering your opponent like in tennis, a well-placed serve in pickleball can throw them off balance and give you the upper hand in any pickleball tournament. It‚Äôs all about precision, consistency, and control.\n\n‚Äç\n\nStill, serving can be confusing, especially for newer players. Can you serve underhand or sidearm? Can you throw the ball up on a volley serve?? What about drop serves, time limits, or serving into the kitchen? And does pickleball even have a ‚Äúlet‚Äù rule?\n\n‚Äç\n\nWe break it all down in this guide, answering the most common questions and clearing up the gray areas.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLet‚Äôs settle it once and for all: What are the serving rules in pickleball?\n\n‚Äç\n\nOfficial Pickleball Serve Rules (2025 Update)\n\n‚Äç\n\n1. Volley Serves¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nA volley serve is when you hit the ball before it bounces, and you can throw the ball up for a volley serve. When you hit the ball, your arm must be in an upward arc, contact can't be made above the waist, and the paddle head must stay below the wrist.\n\n‚Äç\n\n2. One Foot Behind the Baseline\n\n‚Äç\n\nAt least one foot must remain behind the baseline and on the ground until the ball is struck. The other foot can't be on the ground outside the service area.¬† Stepping on the line during the serve is a fault.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n3. Diagonal Placement\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe serve must land in the opposite diagonal service box. If it lands outside the lines or on the kitchen line or in the kitchen (non-volley zone), it‚Äôs a fault.\n\n‚Äç\n\n4. Drop Serve Is Legal\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe drop serve is still legal.. Yep, you heard that right!\n\n‚Äç\n\nWithout applying any force to the ball, you can simply let it drop and hit it after it bounces‚Äîoffering a more flexible and strategic serving option. Your feet must remain in the same position as for a volley serve, but you can drop the ball anywhere, and none of the three volley serve requirements apply.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n5. Single Attempt Only\n\n‚Äç\n\nUnlike in tennis, there are no second chances. If you commit a single fault on your serve, you lose the rally.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n6. No Spin Allowed\n\n‚Äç\n\nYou can‚Äôt spin the ball with your hand or paddle before hitting it. ¬† Only a natural rotation is accepted on the release but, when you hit the ball, put all the spin you want on it!¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nServe Rules for Singles vs Doubles\n\n‚Äç\n\nIn singles, the server switches sides after each point scored, always serving from the right when the score is even and from the left when it's odd. Only the serving person can score points.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nIn doubles, only the serving team can score points.

When their team's score is even, they will serve from the right side of their court.\n\n\n\nGame starts with Player A serving from the right side of the court.\n\n\nEach time Team I scores a point, they switch sides (right to left, left to right) and Player A continues serving.\n\n\nWhen Team I makes a fault, they lose the serve.\n\n\n\nSince it's the start of the game, only Player A serves for Team I. Then it‚Äôs a side out.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPlayer C (Team II) now serves from the right side.\n\n\nJust like before, if Team II scores, the players switch sides and Player C keeps serving until they commit a fault.\n\n\nAfter Player C faults, their partner, Player D, gets to serve.\n\n\nPlayer D serves from the appropriate side based on the score (not necessarily the right side).\n\n\nOnce both players on Team II lose their serves, it‚Äôs a side out, and Team I regains serve; this time, starting on the right, with whichever player matches their score (if their score is even it will be Player A, odd will be Player B), and now both partners will get to serve in that turn.\n\n\n\nThis rotation continues throughout the match, with each player on a team getting a chance to serve‚Äîexcept for the first team to serve, where only one player serves before the side out.\n\n‚Äç\n\nCommon Pickleball Serving Faults\n\n‚Äç\n\nAvoid these errors to stay legal:\n\n‚Äç\n\nHitting the ball above waist level\n\n\nServing into the kitchen or on the kitchen line\n\n\nStepping on¬† the baseline when you make contact with the ball.\n\n\nMissing the cross-court service court!\n\n\n\nBeing aware of these serving faults helps prevent easy point losses, especially when your pickleball rating and performance in pickleball tournaments are on the line.\n\n‚Äç\n\nüëâ 90% of players get these pickleball rules wrong.

Overperform and your rating will go up‚Äîeven if you lose. More accurate. More fair. Learn more today.", "url": "https://www.dupr.com/post/dupr-algo-update-common-questions", "content": "This week, we released an update to the DUPR algorithm: ratings now adjust based on a player‚Äôs performance compared to the expected score. You can read the full update details here.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nWe‚Äôve received a lot of good and thoughtful feedback ‚Äî along with some great questions and concerns. Below, we‚Äôre addressing some of the most common comments to help explain the thinking behind the update and what it means for you.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make sense to go down with a win.‚Äù\n\n\n‚Äç\n\nWe know it‚Äôs never enjoyable to see your rating drop ‚Äî especially after a win.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nOur goal as a rating system is to most accurately measure skill and predict future performance. DUPR is not a reward system, it‚Äôs a rating system.\n\n‚Äç\n\nSo while a win may earn you a trophy, a better seed, or advancement in a tournament, it doesn‚Äôt always mean your rating should go up. If you scored fewer points than expected, that‚Äôs a signal you underperformed relative to your current rating, and we adjust accordingly. The reverse is also true: if you lose but overperform, your rating can rise.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIn all cases, your DUPR reflects performance, not just outcomes, because that‚Äôs what makes the system more accurate for everyone.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúIt makes sense to go up for overperforming in a loss ‚Äî but not down with a win.‚Äù\n\n\n‚Äç\n\nThat sounds nice in theory, but it doesn‚Äôt work in practice.\n\n‚Äç\n\nEach player‚Äôs rating exists within a larger ecosystem. While we aim to assign the most accurate rating to every individual, we also have to maintain the balance of the overall rating system.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIf neither team goes down after a match, the entire distribution would drift upward over time. To keep the system stable and meaningful, one team‚Äôs rating goes up and the other‚Äôs goes down, based on how each performed relative to expectations, not just the result.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúElements like net cords, wind, or fatigue make point-level granularity unfair.‚Äù\n\n\n‚Äç\n\nWe get it ‚Äî not every match is played in perfect conditions. Sometimes the wind, net cords, or fatigue work against you. But here‚Äôs the reality: those same factors can just as easily work for you in other matches.\n\n‚Äç\n\nYour DUPR is built from the full body of your results, not any single match. One unlucky day won‚Äôt define your rating, especially if it‚Äôs already well-established. There will always be some natural swings, but over time, your rating will reflect your true level as long as your performance does too.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúThis hurts high-rated players ‚Äî there‚Äôs no reason for them to play.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\n\nIn each match, both teams have the chance to move up or down based on how they perform compared to expectations.\n\n‚Äç\n\nOur goal as a rating system is to most accurately rate players according to their performance in match results, which is a consistent approach to all levels of players.\n\n‚Äç\n‚Äç\n\n\"Will you adjust ratings with this update?‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nNo, we will not be adjusting ratings at this time.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAs you continue to play, the system will naturally reflect your performance under the new model, improving accuracy across the board.\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this just the old DUPR algorithm?‚Äù\n\n\n‚Äç\n\nIt might feel familiar, and that‚Äôs intentional. This update reintroduces the idea of performance vs. expectation, which was part of a previous version of DUPR. But it‚Äôs not a return to the old system.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR has evolved over time, with updates focused on transparency, user experience, and rating accuracy. Since that earlier version, we‚Äôve added features like near-instant rating updates and more visibility into how each match affects your rating.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis change builds on those improvements, not by going backward, but by combining proven ideas with the features players now expect. We‚Äôre committed to continually refining DUPR to best reflect player performance and the evolving game of pickleball.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor more information, check out our How It Works page."}

Meet Ben Rasey, the Pickleball Director at Lake Geneva Tennis & Pickleball Club, and the driving force behind a community that blends high-level play, heart-pumping cardio, and genuine connection‚Äîall under one roof.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nFrom College Club Founder to DUPR Tournament Director\n\n‚Äç\n\nBen‚Äôs pickleball journey began in the most grassroots way possible‚Äîplaying at public parks during COVID and being adopted into a local league. After returning to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìWhitewater in 2020, he realized there was no official pickleball group on campus. So, he built one from scratch.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat began with just 7 players is now the largest club sport at UW‚ÄìWhitewater, with over 100 active members.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúIn 2023, I helped raise $18,000 for the club. Back then, no club had that kind of money,‚Äù Ben says.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis experience laid the groundwork for what was to come next.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Birth of Lake Geneva‚Äôs Pickleball Scene\n\n‚Äç\n\nBen started working with Lake Geneva Tennis & Pickleball in late 2023, originally running a few events on the side. When the former head pro stepped down, Ben stepped up.\n\n‚Äç\n\nToday, he manages the DUPR club by running monthly tournaments, hosting everything from the Dink Minor League Pickleball events to state championships. Their Christmas tournament draws over 200 players annually, and even their smaller events average 120 players.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat makes Lake Geneva special?\n\n‚Äç\n\n¬†‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just competitive. We‚Äôre fun. We‚Äôre a family,‚Äù Ben says.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nBuilding Community, One Drill and Cardio Class at a Time\n\n‚Äç\n\nLake Geneva‚Äôs programming is as diverse as its players. From drill & play sessions and free intro clinics to kids' classes, pizza parties, and the fan-favorite Cardio Pickleball, Ben has turned the club into a hub for players of all ages and levels.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúCardio Pickleball is the most fun I‚Äôve ever had running an event,‚Äù Ben shares. ‚ÄúWe cap it at 20 people, play games like King of the Court and Beat the Pro, and just hype people up the whole time.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe club recently opened a dedicated 6-court indoor pickleball facility with tournament-level specs: 10 feet of space behind and between courts, sliding court dividers, and upward-facing lights to reduce glare. It‚Äôs built for serious play‚Äîwithout sacrificing the social spirit.\n\n‚Äç\n\nA Culture of Belonging‚Äîand a Bit of Matchmaking\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor Ben, the magic of pickleball goes beyond ratings.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúPickleball changed my life,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt gave me my closest friends. I‚Äôve seen couples meet at my events. It‚Äôs become this unofficial matchmaker.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nHe texts hundreds of players personally before each event, adding little inside jokes and personal notes.\n\n‚Äç\n\n¬†‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not sociable in this role, you‚Äôre going to fail,‚Äù Ben says. ‚ÄúPeople come back because they feel seen and valued.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR-First, Player-Focused\n\n‚Äç\n\nBen has been a DUPR believer since day one‚Äîstarting at the collegiate level and bringing it straight into Lake Geneva‚Äôs core programming.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúPlayers want their ratings to reflect who they really are,‚Äù Ben explains. ‚ÄúWe use DUPR to highlight meaningful competition, not random matchups.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nLake Geneva is now ranked in the top 1% of all DUPR clubs‚Äîwith over 6,000 clubs on the platform.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nMost Clubs Hope for Retention‚Äî This DUPR Club Hit 80%.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nAccording to Ben, Lake Geneva‚Äôs Christmas-time PPA-style tournament brings in an average of 200 players each year. Their Minor League pickleball events, hosted every 7‚Äì8 weeks, consistently draw between 80 and 144 players.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúOur retention rates have been really exciting to track,‚Äù said Ben. ‚ÄúAt one of our recent state championships, 60‚Äì70% of players were brand new‚Äîwhich was awesome. But the tournament before that? We had an 80% return rate. That‚Äôs pretty wild.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nHe credits the strong turnout to running events frequently enough to match players' availability‚Äîwithout overwhelming them.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAdvice for New Club Directors\n\n‚Äç\n\nBen‚Äôs biggest piece of advice?\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúAsk for help. Listen to players. Talk to other clubs who‚Äôve done it. I had to figure out a lot on my own‚Äîbut now that our club is a big success, clubs are coming to us asking what we‚Äôre doing right.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nHe also keeps it simple: be present, be social, and build relationships.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúPickleball is the people's business,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIf they like you, they‚Äôll come back.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat‚Äôs Next?\n\n‚Äç\n\nBen‚Äôs still juggling a full-time job outside of pickleball‚Äîbut don‚Äôt expect him to slow down. He‚Äôs got even more programming, tournaments, and creative events planned as Lake Geneva continues to grow.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAnd if you‚Äôre ever in Wisconsin, don‚Äôt be surprised if you meet your next doubles partner‚Äîor your future spouse‚Äîat one of Ben‚Äôs events.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWant to start a DUPR Club Like Lake Geneva?\n\n‚Äç\n\nFill out this form and an account manager will guide you on how to succeed with your pickleball programming."}

It is used to ‚Äúreset‚Äù the pace of the rally, often after a fast exchange or when a player is under pressure.\n\n‚Äç\n\nInstead of hitting a hard counter, players use a reset to drop the ball gently into the non-volley zone (also known as the kitchen), allowing time to recover and transition to the net.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy is Resetting Important?\n\n‚Äç\n\nMastering the reset shot is key for:\n\nRegaining control of the point¬†\nMoving up into the kitchen¬†\nTransitioning from defense to offense\nImproving overall court strategy\nHow to Perform a Reset\n\n‚Äç\n\nGrip and Paddle Angle: Use a soft grip and open paddle face.\nBody Position: Stay low with bent knees and keep your paddle out front.\nSoft Hands: Focus on absorbing the pace of the ball.\nTarget Area: Aim for the kitchen with a gentle arc.\nRecovery: Be ready to advance to the non-volley line.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nPracticing resets regularly will not only help with defense but also improve your confidence during pickleball tournaments where pressure situations are common.\n\n‚Äç\n\nResets vs. Dinks\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhile both resets and dinks involve soft touch, they serve different purposes. A dink is typically used in an established kitchen rally, while a reset transitions a point into a dink rally. Both are critical shots to master and heavily influence your pickleball strategy.\n\n‚Äç\n\nReset To Improve Your Pickleball Ratings\n\n‚Äç\n\nA solid reset can be the difference between a 3.5 and a 4.0 player. The ability to control the pace and force your opponent into neutral exchanges plays a significant role in pickleball ratings and success in pickleball tournaments.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLooking to raise your DUPR? Start by adding resets to your training program. Keep practicing, study the best, and track your progress using DUPR.\n\n‚Äç"}

That‚Äôs the magic of the slice.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAnd lucky for you, pro player Bobbi Oshiro dropped some gems on how to actually hit it right.\n\n‚Äç\nFirst, What Is a Slice in Pickleball?\n\n‚Äç\n\nIn pickleball, a slice‚Äîor backspin shot‚Äîis made by swinging the paddle in a downward motion, which puts reverse spin on the ball. This causes the ball to travel slower, stay low after the bounce, and skid toward your opponent, making it tough for them to attack.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhile everyone‚Äôs out there practicing their Erne or lining up a cheeky Nasty Nelson, don‚Äôt forget: mastering the slice (and knowing your pickleball rules) can win you just as many points‚Äîquietly and efficiently.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nPro Tips from Bobbi Oshiro: How to Hit the Perfect Slice\n\n‚Äç\n\nPro pickleball player Bobbi Oshiro shared her go-to technique for slicing, and here's exactly how she breaks it down:\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚úÖ Grip:\n\n‚Äç\n\nUse a continental grip for better control and natural slice mechanics.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚úÖ Paddle Angle:\n\n‚Äç\n\nAngle the face of your paddle slightly upward‚Äîthis helps apply that crisp backspin.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚úÖ Swing Path:\n\n‚Äç\n\nStart your swing high\n\nFollow a high-to-low trajectory\n\n\nKeep your wrist and elbow locked\n\n\nUse your shoulder to drive the motion, not your wrist\n‚Äç\n\n‚úÖ Follow-Through:\n\n‚Äç\n\nKeep it low and forward toward your target. You‚Äôre not trying to hit a winner‚Äîyou're placing a ball that‚Äôs tough to attack.\n\n‚Äç\nWhen Should You Use a Slice?\n\n‚Äç\n\nAccording to Bobbi, here are the best times to use a slice:\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhen pulled wide or in a defensive position\n\n\nTo reset the point and buy yourself time\n\n\nTo mix up your spin game and keep opponents guessing\n\n\nTo force a low bounce and make their next shot tougher\n\n‚Äç\n\nSlice Your Way to Higher Pickleball Ratings\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nSmarter shot selections lead to more wins‚Äîand that means higher pickleball ratings.

Master it, and you will be one step closer to improving your pickleball ratings.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat Is the Non-Volley Zone?\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Non-Volley Zone (NVZ)‚Äîbetter known as the kitchen‚Äîis the 7-foot area on both sides of the net.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLet‚Äôs be clear: It‚Äôs totally legal to stand in the kitchen‚Äîjust not while hitting a volley, or if your momentum carries you into it after a volley.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThinking about hitting an Erne or attacking up at the net?\n\n‚Äç\nKnow the rules first‚Äîor risk giving up free points.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBecause when it comes to your DUPR pickleball ratings, every point counts.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy Is the NVZ Called \"The Kitchen\"?\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nThere‚Äôs no definitive origin story for why it‚Äôs called ‚Äúthe kitchen‚Äù in pickleball, but the most widely accepted theory links it to shuffleboard. In shuffleboard, the ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù is a penalty zone‚Äîland there, and you lose 10 points. While the rules are different, the concept is similar: it‚Äôs a restricted space where bad positioning can cost you. In pickleball, stepping into the kitchen at the wrong time‚Äîespecially during a volley‚Äîresults in a fault. (Thankfully, it‚Äôs just one point, not ten.)\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe nickname isn‚Äôt officially documented, but it‚Äôs stuck‚Äîand for good reason. If you‚Äôre serious about your game (and your DUPR rating), you‚Äôll learn to respect the kitchen.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Importance of the NVZ in Pickleball Tournaments\n\n‚Äç\n\nMastering your footwork around the Non-Volley Zone (NVZ) is essential‚Äîespecially in tournament play, where the pace is faster and margins are tight.\n\nHigh-level players don‚Äôt avoid the kitchen‚Äîthey use it. The NVZ becomes a tool to slow the game down, control tempo, reset points, and bait opponents into making mistakes.\n\n‚Äç\n\nüèì Key NVZ Tips:\n\n‚Äç\n\nStay low and balanced‚Äîgood footwork = fewer pop-ups\n\n\nDink with purpose, not just to keep the rally going\n\n\nUse angles to pull your opponent wide and open up the court\n\n\nKnow when to reset vs. attack‚Äîtiming is everything\n\n‚Äç\n\n\nüé• Check out Bobbi Oshiro‚Äôs tips on using the NVZ effectively in singles play.\n\n‚Äç\n\nNVZ Rules You Must Know\n\n‚Äç\n\nHere are some core pickleball rules regarding the NVZ:\n\n‚Äç\n\nNo volleying while touching the NVZ line: Your feet must be behind the line if you want to hit a volley.\n\n‚Äç\n\n\nMomentum counts: Even if you hit the volley outside the NVZ, if your momentum carries you into the zone afterward, it's a fault.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDinking is legal: You can hit the ball inside the kitchen if it has bounced first. This opens up one of the most strategic plays in pickleball‚Äîthe dink.\n\n\nNVZ Strategy\n\n‚Äç\n\nPlayers who use the NVZ effectively tend to:\n\n‚Äç\n\nExtend rallies\n\n\nReduce unforced errors\n\n\nWin more dink battles\n\n\nPerform better in competitive environments\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhether you call it the Non-Volley Zone or the kitchen, mastering this space is vital for players looking to excel in pickleball. From casual play to competitive pickleball tournaments, understanding how to move, position, and strike in relation to the NVZ can give you a strategic edge.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWant to raise your pickleball rating?

But what exactly is an ATP in pickleball‚Äîand how can it improve your game and your pickleball ratings?\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat does ATP stand for in pickleball?\n\n‚Äç\n\nATP stands for Around The Post, one of the most exciting and skillful shots in pickleball. Unlike most shots that travel over the net, an ATP travels around the net post‚Äîcompletely outside the boundary of the net‚Äîand still lands inbounds on your opponent‚Äôs side.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIs the ATP Legal?\n\n‚Äç\n\nYes! According to official pickleball rules, a ball does not need to go over the net, as long as:\n\n‚Äç\n\nIt crosses to the opponent‚Äôs side,\n\n\nLands within the court boundaries, and\n\n\nThe player does not touch the net or opponent‚Äôs court..\n\n\nWhen to Hit an ATP Shot\n\n‚Äç\n\nATP opportunities usually happen when your opponent hits a sharp-angled dink or drive that pulls you far off the court. If that ball bounces near the sideline, you may have a clean angle to hit an ATP.\n\n‚Äç\n\nKey tip from the pros: Be patient and wait as long as you can to hit the shot.¬† The longer you wait, the better angle you have to hit the ball around the post.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe ATP and Competitive Pickleball Tournaments\n\n‚Äç\n\nIn high-level pickleball tournaments, the ATP isn‚Äôt just a flashy shot‚Äîit can be a momentum-shifting tactic. Players who master it can surprise opponents, win crowd-pleasing points, and show off a deep understanding of pickleball strategy.\n\n‚Äç\n\nKey Pickleball Rules for ATP Shots\n\n‚Äç\n\nYou can go around the net post, but cannot touch the net, posts, or your opponent‚Äôs court while the ball is live.\n\n\nThe ball must land in bounds, even though it travels around the net.\n\n\nIf your momentum carries you onto the opponent‚Äôs court‚Äîor if anything you‚Äôre wearing or holding (like a paddle or hat) crosses the line before your shot‚Äîit‚Äôs a fault.\n\n\nYou can‚Äôt cross the imaginary extension of the net unless you‚Äôve already made contact with the ball (unless the ball has already bounced on your end of the court and has bounced back to the opponent‚Äôs end. Yeah, it gets complicated!)\n\n\nHow to Practice the ATP\n\n‚Äç\n\nWant to add the ATP to your game? Try this:\n\n‚Äç\n\nDrill wide-angle dinks with a partner to simulate real ATP scenarios.\n\n\nFocus on footwork‚Äîpositioning early is everything.\n\n\nWork on paddle angle and follow-through to keep your shot low and in bounds.\n\n‚Äç\n\n\n\nThe ATP is more than just a flashy highlight‚Äîit‚Äôs a powerful, legal weapon when executed correctly.

What started as a \"stupid little game\" he tried with his kids in the neighborhood quickly spiraled into something much more. Today, Brad is a DUPR Coach, RPPK Master Instructor, and proud dad to a crew of five highly rated pickleball players.\n\n‚Äç\n‚Äç\nA Family That Pickleballs Together\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"We have five kids; my daughter is my mixed partner, and my sons coach as well,‚Äù Brad shared. ‚ÄúOne's a 5.7 DUPR, the other is a 5.0 and my daughter is a 4.5\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nEven cooler? Their pickleball skills helped them to transition to other sports. It took his daughter only 6 months to learn tennis and become #2 on her high school team, qualifying for the State Championship. According to Brad, the transition was seamless. \"She picked up volleys and quick hands from pickleball. That gave her the confidence to rush the net in tennis while others stayed back.\"\n\n‚Äç\n‚Äç\nCalling out the \"Anyone Can Teach\" Myth\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"Anyone can teach... But not everyone can teach well,\" Brad joked.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat separates a great coach from a decent player, he explained, is patience, strategy, and an actual framework.\n\n‚Äç\n\nA lot of high-rated players think they can coach‚Äîbut playing well doesn‚Äôt always translate to teaching well. ‚ÄúWe need structure in this sport,‚Äù Brad explained. ‚ÄúCertification ensures you‚Äôre not passing down bad habits or outdated strategies.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\nHow DUPR Ratings Changed the Game\n\n‚Äç\n\nBrad doesn‚Äôt just coach‚Äîhe rates. As a DUPR Coach, Brad runs multiple rating sessions each week, using them not only to help players get started, but also to build long-term relationships.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúA lot of the Picklr facilities are DUPR-limiting their leagues and open plays. If someone doesn‚Äôt have a DUPR, they can‚Äôt even get into those events.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nMore and more clubs are making having a DUPR rating a requirement, and that gives certified DUPR Coaches like Brad the chance to connect with players right from the beginning.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúPlayers meet you during the session and see how you coach. It‚Äôs a great way to build relationships‚Äîand grow your coaching business.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nOnce a player has a rating, the journey doesn‚Äôt stop there. Brad works with many players whose goal is simple: raise their DUPR.\n\n‚Äç\n‚Äç\n‚ÄúI have several athletes that I work with who are always trying to raise their DUPR. That‚Äôs their ultimate goal. So we‚Äôre coming up with strategies, matches, and game plans that can help them get there.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor Brad‚Äôs students, coaching goes beyond technique‚Äîit‚Äôs about access. To better matchups, more competitive events, and a better overall experience. And it all starts with the right rating.\n\n‚Äç\n‚ÄúEveryone thinks they‚Äôre better than they really are.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúPeople sign up for tournaments thinking they‚Äôre a 3.5, then get trashed and only play two games after paying a lot of money,‚Äù Brad noted.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThat‚Äôs why getting rated by a DUPR Coach matters. It‚Äôs the fastest, fairest way to figure out where you actually stand‚Äîso you can start in the right bracket, have a great time, and build from there.\n\n‚Äç\nWhy Arizona Is Leading the Pickleball Boom Right Now\n\n‚Äç\n\nAccording to Coach Brad Lees, Arizona‚Äôs rise as a pickleball hotspot comes down to three key factors: great weather, an active outdoor lifestyle, and a rapid increase in courts and events.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe state regularly hosts major tournaments like PPA and Major League Pickleball, drawing large crowds and growing interest at every level. Arizona is also home to many local pro players, adding to the region‚Äôs competitive energy.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúThere are five Picklr facilities in the Valley already,‚Äù Brad shared, ‚Äúand there are even plans for a new indoor facility with 50 courts.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\n¬†With more events, more courts, and more talent, it‚Äôs no surprise amateur participation is surging across the state.\n\n‚Äç\nWhy Coaching Education Matters\n\n‚Äç\n\nCoach Brad Lees believes structured programs like RPPK are essential for growing the sport the right way. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre making up your own curriculum every time, players get inconsistent instruction‚Äîand that‚Äôs not good for anyone,‚Äù he shared.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhile it‚Äôs natural to adjust lessons for different players, a strong foundation helps ensure that players learn the right habits from day one and can actually progress.\n\n‚Äç\nRPPK Isn‚Äôt Just About Curriculum\n\n‚Äç\n\nBeyond the teaching framework, Brad pointed out the practical perks of certification‚Äîlike liability insurance, which is often required at parks and facilities. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre coaching without insurance, you‚Äôre taking a big risk. Accidents happen‚Äîbetter to be covered.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nRPPK also gives coaches credibility, structure, and tools that help them deliver more consistent, effective instruction‚Äîand stand out in a growing field.\n\n‚Äç\nThe Future: DUPR + RPPK as the Standard\n\n‚Äç\n\nBrad envisions a future where every club and league uses DUPR ratings and RPPK certification as the norm.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never had one clear coaching standard in pickleball. But with RPPK‚Äôs structure and DUPR‚Äôs reach, we finally could. That‚Äôs how we build long-term growth‚Äîand do it the right way.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWant to learn more about becoming a Master Instructor?

Daytona (June 5‚Äì8) marks the fifth event on the calendar, with five more stops still to come before the postseason begins.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWith pickleball ratings and team performance shaping the playoff picture, let‚Äôs break down where teams stand after Phoenix‚Äîand who‚Äôs in (and out) of contention.\n\nCurrent Standings (Post-Phoenix)\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nRanked by Points per Match to account for unequal games played\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Battle for the Final Playoff Spots\n\n‚Äç\n\nIt‚Äôs shaping up to be a three-team race for the final two playoff spots. The Utah Black Diamonds, Miami Pickleball Club, and Chicago Slice are all within striking distance heading into the second half of the season.\n\n‚Äç\n\nShoutout to Chicago, who had to completely redraft their roster after last season and still managed to stay in the hunt. With five events left, momentum swings, injuries, burnouts and a sense of urgency could shake things up quickly. And if sports have taught us anything‚Äîit‚Äôs that passion and grit can go a long way!\n\n‚Äç\n\nLack of Parity: A Growing Concern?\n\n‚Äç\n\nA recent stat shared by Matty Pickles (and featured in The Dink newsletter) highlighted something striking:¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe top 8 teams are a combined 42‚Äì0 against the bottom 8.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nYep‚Äîundefeated. That‚Äôs a huge gap.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAll four teams that moved up from last season‚Äôs Challenger division currently sit in the bottom 8, showing just how tough it is to draft well when depth in the MLP talent pool is still developing. Many of these teams had to take chances on new talent, which often takes time to pay off.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThat said, if any bottom-8 team is going to pull off an upset, my bet‚Äôs on Miami. Any team going against them must be mentally present to fight. They‚Äôve got fire and fight‚Äîtwo things you can‚Äôt coach.\n\n‚Äç\n\nNewbies vs. Veterans\n\n‚Äç\n\nBack in March, I published a blog on the MLP roster updates following the Premier and Challenger Drafts held on March 2‚Äì3. I highlighted the wave of new talent entering the league this season ‚Äî and now that we‚Äôre halfway through, let‚Äôs take a look at how those players have performed so far.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAt the time, I noted 34 new players had been drafted across both Premier and Challenger divisions‚Äînone of whom had played an MLP match in 2024. Most were picked in the 5th or 6th round, so many haven‚Äôt seen any court time yet.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThose who have broken into the starting lineups include:\nVictoria Di Muzio, Liz Truluck, Max Freeman, Mya Bui, Alex Walker, and, yes‚Äî¬æ of the NY Hustlers.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nFrom that group, Victoria, Max, Mya, and the Hustlers trio have consistently started matches for their teams. Mya Bui stands out as the strongest performer so far, though all five are currently ranked outside the Top 50 in the player standings.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIt‚Äôs worth remembering: most veteran players have been competing at a high level for years. These newcomers are still adjusting to the pace and pressure of top-tier play. With time, mentorship, and experience, several of them could absolutely become key contributors in future seasons.\n\n‚Äç\n\nüèÜ Semifinal Predictions: Early Call\n\n‚Äç\n\nYou can prove me wrong later, but I‚Äôm seeing a repeat of last season‚Äôs semifinals.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nRight now, my top four picks heading into August are:\n\nSt. Louis Shock\n\n\nNew Jersey 5s\n\n\nDallas Flash\n\n\nTexas Ranchers\n\n\n\nThese teams have shown the most consistency and depth so far this season.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAs for the final? I‚Äôd put my money on a Dallas Flash vs. St. Louis Shock matchup. Two strong, well-balanced rosters that know how to close.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLet‚Äôs see how it plays out.\n\n‚Äç"}

Fault.\n\n‚Äç\n\n2. Doubles Play\n\n‚Äç\n\nYour partner finishes a great volley at the net, but they stumble forward into the kitchen. Momentum fault, even if the ball was unreachable.\n\n‚Äç\n\n3. Equipment Drop\n\n‚Äç\n\nYour paddle drops into the kitchen after a volley‚Äîstill a momentum fault.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow to Avoid Momentum Faults\n\n‚Äç\n\nImproving your footwork and body control near the kitchen line can help you avoid losing points.\n\nTry these tips:\n\n‚Äç\n\nStay balanced after every volley‚Äîdon‚Äôt overreach.\n\n\nAvoid lunging unless you‚Äôre sure you can stop safely.\n\n\nDrill footwork near the kitchen so it becomes second nature.\n\n\nPractice ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù drills to control forward movement after contact.\n\n\nWatch for ‚Äúline creep‚Äù‚Äîinching forward during fast-paced points leads to accidental faults.\n\n‚Äç\n\nMomentum faults are avoidable‚Äîbut only if you know what to watch for.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhether you're training for a local pickleball tournament or playing socially, minimizing avoidable faults is key to progress as a player and start boosting your pickleball ratings.\n\n‚Äç\n\nNext time you‚Äôre chasing that perfect volley, don‚Äôt let your momentum turn a winning shot into a kitchen disaster.\n\n‚Äç"}

A Nasty Nelson is the kind of shot that can flip the momentum of a game, leaving opponents flustered and teammates grinning at the well-executed disruption. But what exactly is a Nasty Nelson, and why does it carry such a mischievous reputation?\n\n‚Äç\n\nJust ask Mariana Paredes, who famously pulled off a Nasty Nelson at 10-4 match point to clinch a gold medal at the US Open. In her post-match interview with The Dink, she said, ‚ÄúI saw an opportunity and took it. Nothing wrong with that!‚Äù Bold? Definitely. Controversial? Maybe. But moments like that are exactly why the Nasty Nelson continues to spark debate on pickleball courts everywhere.\n‚Äç\nThe rudest shot in pickleball?\n\n‚Äç\n\nIn pickleball, the serve is your first chance to set the tone, control the pace, and occasionally catch your opponents off guard. A Nasty Nelson does exactly that‚Äîit‚Äôs a serve aimed intentionally at the non-receiving partner, trying to hit them before the ball bounces. If it hits the non-receiver player, it results in an immediate fault on the receiving team‚Äîone of the few ways to score outright off a serve.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nIt‚Äôs not illegal under the official pickleball rules, but it‚Äôs definitely unconventional‚Äîand depending on who you ask, maybe even a little unsportsmanlike. If you‚Äôre chasing better pickleball ratings, a well-timed Nasty Nelson might score you a point‚Ä¶ but it could also cost you a friend.\n\n‚Äç\nWhen to execute a Nasty Nelson?\n\n‚Äç\n\nSome players use the Nasty Nelson strategically, especially in official pickleball tournaments where every point counts. If the opposing partner isn‚Äôt paying attention or stands too close to the kitchen, they‚Äôre a prime target. Others argue that it goes against the spirit of the game, preferring serves that challenge the receiver through placement and spin rather than deception.\n\n‚Äç\nWhy is it called Nasty Nelson?¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nTim ‚ÄúThe Puppet Master‚Äù Nelson is the guy behind the shot everyone loves to argue about‚Äîthe Nasty Nelson. He‚Äôs a top-level pickleball player known for his bold (and sometimes sneaky) style of play. The shot was named after him for a reason‚Äîhe used it often, and with zero shame. He‚Äôs also famous for doing a little puppeteer hand motion after pulling it off, just to rub it in a bit more.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\nShould you use it?\n\n‚Äç\n\nLike any shot in pickleball‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a third shot drop, ATP, or Erne‚Äîthe Nasty Nelson is a tool. Whether you use it or avoid it depends on your style of play.\n\n‚Äç\n\nOne thing‚Äôs for sure: if you're serious about climbing the pickleball ratings ladder or competing in Minor League Pickleball events, understanding shots like this gives you an edge‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs just to defend yourself against the opponent trying to pull one over on you.\n\n‚Äç\n\nSo next time you‚Äôre on the court, stay alert during the serve. You never know when a little bit of ‚Äúnasty‚Äù might be headed your way.\n\n‚Äç"}

That move? It's called an Erne.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat Is an Erne?\n\n‚Äç\n\nAn Erne is a legal volley hit near the net, outside the non-volley zone (kitchen). It‚Äôs typically executed by jumping over or running around the NVZ. A player can even run through the NVZ‚Äîas long as the player doesn‚Äôt strike the ball until both feet have landed completely outside the zone. You can even volley the ball while in the air, as long as you never touch the NVZ or its lines. This aggressive move allows players to take the ball early and close to the net while staying fully within the rules.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis aggressive shot is named after Erne Perry, a pickleball player who frequently used the move in tournament play.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy Is the Erne Legal?\n\n‚Äç\n\nAccording to official pickleball rules, you can't volley a ball while standing inside the non-volley zone (NVZ) ¬†However, you can legally enter the NVZ‚Äîas long as both feet make contact with the ground outside the zone before hitting a volley.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThere are a few ways to legally execute an Erne:\n\n‚Äç\n\nJump over the sideline and land outside the NVZ\n\n\nRun through the NVZ and land with both feet outside before making contact\n\n\nStay airborne and strike the ball before landing, as long as you never touch the NVZ or its lines\n\n‚Äç\n\n\n‚úÖ The key: if you‚Äôve touched the NVZ then you cannot volley the ball until both feet make contact fully outside the NVZ.\n\n‚Äç\nHow Does an Erne Work Strategically?\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Erne is a high-risk, high-reward shot. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs effective:\n\n‚Äç\n\nSurprises opponents by taking time away\nCuts off dinks or slow cross-court shots near the sideline\nForces weak returns or outright winners\n\n‚Äç\n\nHowever, if timed wrong, it leaves you out of position and vulnerable. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs usually used by advanced players rated 4.0 and above.¬†\n\n‚Äç\nHow to Practice an Erne?\n\n‚Äç\n\nAnticipate the shot: Look for predictable cross-court dinks or pop-ups near the sideline\nPosition early: Get to the edge of the NVZ before the ball crosses the net\nTime your move: Lunge or jump to hit the ball at its peak\n\n‚Äç\n\nStay legal: If you‚Äôve touched the NVZ, avoid volleying the ball until both feet make contact outside the NVZ.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Erne is one of the most exciting and bold moves in pickleball. It‚Äôs not easy to pull off, but when done right, it adds pressure, flair, and momentum to your game. Whether you're aiming to climb your DUPR rating or just shake things up in rec play, the Erne is a move worth learning.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç"}

If you want to play smarter and raise your pickleball ratings ‚Äî this one‚Äôs for you.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Double Bounce Rule is one of the core regulations in pickleball. It states that both teams must allow the ball to bounce once on each side before volleys (hitting the ball in the air without a bounce) are permitted:\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe receiving team must let the serve bounce before returning the ball.\nThe serving team must also let the return bounce before hitting their next shot.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy Does the Double Bounce Rule Matter?\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis rule is crucial for keeping pickleball balanced and strategic. Here‚Äôs why:\n\n‚Äç\n\nPrevents unfair advantage‚ÄîThe serving team doesn‚Äôt immediately dominate by rushing the net.\nEncourages longer rallies‚ÄîSince players must play from deeper positions initially, points last longer and are more engaging.\nSupports controlled play‚ÄîBeginners and advanced players alike must approach each rally with strategy, rather than sheer power.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow to Use the Double Bounce Rule to Your Advantage\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhile the rule might seem like a simple requirement, smart players use it strategically to control the game. Here are some pro tips:\n\n‚Äç\n\nAim deep returns‚ÄîA well-placed return that pushes opponents back makes their next shot harder.\nAnticipate the bounce‚ÄîKnowing exactly where the ball will land allows for quicker reaction time.\nSet up for strong volleys‚ÄîAfter the initial two bounces, be ready to move up and take control with fast-paced shots.\n\n‚Äç\n\nCommon Mistakes Players Make\n\n‚Äç\n\nEven experienced players occasionally slip up on the Double Bounce Rule. Here are a few mistakes to avoid:\n\n‚Äç\n\nHitting the return before it bounces‚ÄîRemember, you must let the serve bounce before playing your shot.\nRushing the net too soon‚ÄîStay patient!

On-Court Movement & Footwork\nWork on side-to-side agility to improve baseline and NVZ coverage.\nFast split-step drills to react quicker at the net.\nCrossover step drills for efficient recovery between shots.\n\n‚Äç\n\n4. Mental Toughness & Strategic Play\n\nWhen competing against players of similar skill, your mental toughness can be the deciding factor in securing the \"W.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nStay calm under pressure and minimize unforced errors.\nPlay high-percentage shots and avoid unnecessary risks.\nAnalyze opponents and adjust your strategy based on their weaknesses.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBy following this 4-week training plan, you‚Äôll develop consistency, control, and confidence on the court. But remember, practice alone won‚Äôt boost your DUPR rating ‚Äî you need to compete and perform well in matches.

A well-fueled body can sustain energy levels, maintain focus, and enhance recovery, while poor nutrition can lead to low energy and stamina, slower reaction times, and costly errors.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIf you're struggling to close out tight matches or finding yourself fatigued late in the day, your diet could be the culprit. In fact, bad nutrition could be the main contributor to a loss, damaging your DUPR pickleball rating and holding you back from reaching your full potential on the court.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHere‚Äôs a guide to help you implement a strategic approach to nutrition‚Äìbefore, during, and after play so you always compete at your best.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nPre-Match Nutrition: What to Eat Before a Pickleball Match?\n\nYour pre-match meal plays a crucial role in preparing your body for the demands of competition. Eating the right balance of macronutrients will help ensure sustained energy levels and mental sharpness. Proper pre-match nutrition supports glycogen storage, muscle function, and hydration, all of which are critical for peak performance, which may lead to boosting your pickleball ratings.\n\n‚Äç\n\n60-90 Minutes Before Play:\nCarbohydrates: 1g/kg of body weight (provides energy for high-intensity movements and sustains endurance by preserving muscle glycogen stores)\nProtein: 0.3 - 0.55g/kg of body weight (supports muscle function, reduces muscle breakdown, and promotes neurotransmitter balance for mental sharpness)\nFat & Fiber: Keep minimal to prevent digestive discomfort, as they slow gastric emptying and may lead to bloating or sluggishness\n‚ÄçIdeal snacks pre-match:\nA banana with Greek yogurt and honey\nOatmeal with a scoop of protein powder and low-fat milk\nA turkey wrap with some grapes\nLow-fat cottage cheese with pretzels¬†\nIn-Match Nutrition: Sustaining Energy Levels\n\nDuring matches, your body continues to burn glycogen, and dehydration can set in quickly, leading to fatigue, slowed reaction time, and decreased cognitive function. Proper in-match nutrition helps sustain your endurance, power, and focus, ensuring you stay sharp until the final point.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat to Eat During A Pickleball Match?\n\nYour goal for between-match nutrition is to maintain energy without causing digestive distress. Stick to easily digestible, familiar foods that won‚Äôt weigh you down but will keep you sharp and ready for your next pickleball tournament:\n\nHydration: Aim for 4-8 ounces of water or an electrolyte drink every 15-20 minutes to maintain fluid balance and prevent dehydration.\nCarbohydrates for Energy: If matches extend beyond 60 minutes, consume 30-60g of carbohydrates per hour to prevent glycogen depletion.\nElectrolytes: Replenish sodium, potassium, and magnesium to reduce the risk of muscle cramps and maintain nerve function if sweating profusely.\nQuick Digesting Snacks: Stick to easily digestible, low-fiber foods to prevent gastrointestinal discomfort while providing quick energy.\n\n‚ÄçIdeal Snacks Between Matches:\n\nApplesauce packets\nRice cakes with honey\nFresh watermelon or bananas\nEnergy bars with simple ingredients\nA small peanut butter and jelly sandwich\nElectrolyte drinks to replenish lost fluids and minerals if sweating profusely\n\n‚Äç\n\nIgnoring in-match nutrition can lead to low energy levels and mental fatigue‚Äîboth of which can cost you critical points that will affect your pickleball ratings, and, ultimately, the match.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPost-Match Recovery: Rebuilding for the Next Challenge\n\nAfter each match, focus on replenishing energy stores and supporting muscle recovery. Proper recovery nutrition ensures that you maintain a high level of play throughout the tournament, rather than declining in later rounds.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPost-Match Nutrition Guidelines (unless playing back-to-back games):\nCarbohydrates: 0.5-1.0g/kg of body weight (replenishes glycogen stores and restores energy levels)\nProtein: 0.2-0.3g/kg of body weight (repairs muscle tissue, reduces soreness, and prevents breakdown)\nFluids: Rehydrate with 16-24 ounces of water or an electrolyte beverage per pound of body weight lost during play.\n\nWeigh yourself before and after to estimate fluid loss\n\n‚ÄçIdeal snacks post-match:\n\nA protein smoothie with banana and almond milk\nChocolate milk and a handful of pretzels\nA turkey sandwich on whole-grain bread\nLow-fat cottage cheese and toast\n\n‚Äç\n\nOptimizing Long-Term Nutrition for Pickleball\n\nBeyond match-day nutrition, your daily intake can have a significant impact on performance, endurance, and recovery. ‚ÄãOptimizing your long-term nutrition is crucial for enhancing pickleball performance, improving your pickleball ratings, supporting recovery, and maintaining overall health. Incorporating evidence-based dietary strategies can help you meet the physical demands of the sport and achieve your performance goals.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄçCarbohydrate Recommendations for Training Levels:\n\nLow Activity (Recreational Play): 3-5g/kg/day\nModerate Training (1h/day): 5-7g/kg/day\nHigh Training (2-3h/day): 6-10g/kg/day\n\nProtein Intake for Muscle Maintenance and Recovery\n\nGeneral Needs: 1.2-1.6g/kg/day\n\nHydration for Performance and Everyday Health\n\nHydration is critical for maintaining endurance, cognitive function, and recovery. Even a slight level of dehydration can impair performance and increase the risk of muscle cramps.\n\n‚ÄçDaily Fluid Recommendations\n\nMen: ~3.7L (15.5 cups) per day\nWomen: ~2.7L (11.5 cups) per day\n\n‚Äç\n\nElectrolytes, particularly sodium and potassium, should be replenished through sports drinks or salty snacks if you're sweating excessively.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Bottom Line: Nutrition Wins Matches\n\nIf you're serious about improving your DUPR rating and competing at the highest level, your nutrition needs to be a priority in tandem with your training. If you struggle in long matches or fade late in tournaments, optimizing your nutrition before, during, and after play can help you compete at your highest level.\n\nA bad diet can be the reason you lose a match you should have won.¬† By consistently applying proper nutrition strategies, you can enhance your endurance, sharpen cognitive function, and accelerate recovery, giving you the best shot at success every time you step onto the court.\n\n‚ÄçAIM7 app‚Äôs innovative technology allows you to:\n\nTrack your workouts with precision\nMonitor your intensity levels to understand nutrition needs\nCustomize fitness and recovery programs based on your fitness level\nTrack your progress and celebrate your achievements\n\nTake the first step to a healthier, stronger you.

Utah Tech's pickleball team, the reigning Collegiate National Champions, is gearing up for another shot at glory. As the Trailblazers prepare to defend their title, there‚Äôs one thing that‚Äôs clear: this squad isn‚Äôt just resting on last year‚Äôs success‚Äîthey‚Äôre building on it.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBusiness as Usual‚ÄîBut With a Championship Mindset\n\nAsk any of the players, and they'll tell you the same thing: the foundation of their success hasn‚Äôt changed much. \"We‚Äôre all competitive and goal-driven when it comes to our personal development,\" one team member shared. \"We‚Äôre also really close off the court, and that chemistry shows when we‚Äôre playing and training together.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nThat tight-knit bond, paired with relentless work ethic, continues to define Utah Tech‚Äôs approach. The team spends countless hours training together, pushing each other, and keeping the standard high‚Äîbecause they know that staying at the top is even harder than getting there.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFine-Tuning the Formula: Consistency & Composure\n\nHeading into this year‚Äôs tournament, the Trailblazers are sharpening their edge. ‚ÄúConsistency is everything,‚Äù says the team. One key area of focus has been high-percentage shots‚Äîminimizing errors and maximizing scoring opportunities. But it‚Äôs not just physical preparation that matters.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve also been working on the mental side of things. DUPR Nationals get crazy‚Äîevery school is watching, cheering, sometimes heckling. We‚Äôre training ourselves to stay locked in, stay composed, and block out the noise.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nConfidence Meets Pressure\n\nBeing the defending champs brings a mix of swagger and scrutiny. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre definitely confident‚Äîwe know what we‚Äôre capable of,‚Äù a player admitted. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs pressure, too. Everyone wants to see the champs fall. We‚Äôre using that as fuel. We want to go back-to-back.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis mix of high confidence and grounded awareness could be exactly what gives the Trailblazers their edge. They know what it takes to win‚Äîand they‚Äôre ready to rise to the occasion once again.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLessons From the Top\n\nLooking back at last year‚Äôs championship run, the players credit their victory to a few essential ingredients: rock-solid consistency, excellent coaching, team-first mentality, and focused practice sessions that mimic the intensity and unpredictability of tournament play.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThat experience gave them more than just a trophy‚Äîit reshaped their mindset. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre determined. We know how to win. And we love to have fun doing it. That balance of competitiveness and joy is what makes us great, both as a team and as individual players.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nEyes on the Prize\n\nAs the Trailblazers head into this year‚Äôs Collegiate National Championship, one thing is certain: they‚Äôre not just defending a title‚Äîthey‚Äôre chasing another one. So whether you're cheering from the stands or watching from afar, get ready. Utah Tech is coming in hot, and they‚Äôve got every intention of blazing the trail all the way to another championship win.\n\n‚Äç\n\nMake sure to follow all the action from Collegiate Nationals on Instagram at @duprpb and @collegiateickleball for the latest scores, highlights, and behind-the-scenes coverage."}

Drilling is key‚Äîbut not just any drilling. Drilling with intention and using realistic setups can elevate your game in ways casual hitting never will. One of the most effective and engaging ways to do this? Three-player drills. Listen to these tips from Pro player Bobbi Oshiro.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhether you're a seasoned competitor or just getting serious about improving, incorporating multi-player drills will challenge your decision-making, timing, and court awareness.\n\n‚Äç\n\n2-on-1 at the Kitchen Line: A Realistic Challenge\n\nThis is one of my favorite drills for developing consistency under pressure. It replicates real-game scenarios and keeps all three players actively working on key skills.\n\nDrill Setup:\nPlayer A is alone on one side of the net at the non-volley zone (NVZ)\n\nPlayers B and C are on the opposite side, also at the NVZ.\n\n\nHow It Works:\nPlayer A is on offense, looking for moments to speed up the ball‚Äîideally down the line to a specific target.\n\nPlayers B and C are working together on soft dinks, keeping Player A on the move.\n\nB and C must communicate effectively to determine who takes each ball and adjust positioning as the rally evolves.\n\nPlayer B focuses on anticipating the speed-up and countering quickly.\n\nPlayer C is responsible for covering the middle, a crucial zone during fast-paced exchanges.\n\n\nWhy This Drill Works\n\nThis isn‚Äôt just about hitting balls back and forth‚Äîit‚Äôs about game-like repetition.\n\nFor Player A: It‚Äôs an opportunity to practice patience, pick smart speed-up moments, and work on precision targeting under pressure.\n\nFor Players B and C: It builds chemistry, footwork, and communication, all while refining dink control and defensive positioning.\n\n\n\nBy drilling with three players, you introduce more movement, more strategy, and more realism. And that‚Äôs what translates to better performance in real matches.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFinal Tip:\n\n‚ÄçDon‚Äôt just drill to get reps‚Äîdrill with purpose. Pick a focus for each session and push yourself (and your drilling partners) to replicate match situations as closely as possible.\n\n‚Äç\n\nReady to level up your consistency?

This is one of the most misunderstood but critical rules‚Äîespecially among new players.\n\n‚Äç\n\n2. The Non-Volley Zone (aka The Kitchen)\n\n‚Äç\n\nNo volleys allowed while standing in the non-volley zone. But here‚Äôs the part players miss: if your momentum carries you into the kitchen‚Äîeven after a clean volley‚Äîit‚Äôs a fault. We'll break that down later.\n\n‚Äç\n\n3. Serving Rules¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nServe underhand with contact equal or below the waist.\n\n\nOne foot must be on the ground behind the baseline at the time of contact - the other foot doesn't have to be on the ground but if it is, it has to be behind the baseline.\n\n\nServe diagonally across the court.\nYour serve must land BEHIND the kitchen line.\n\n\nYou get only one serve attempt (no let serves ‚Äî this isn‚Äôt tennis).\n\n\n4. Pickleball Scoring System\n\n‚Äç\n\nLet‚Äôs clear this up once and for all: in pickleball, only the serving team can score. Most games are played to 11 points, and yes‚Äîyou‚Äôve got to win by 2. That‚Äôs the standard across recreational play and official events like DUPR Rating Sessions and RTM (Road to Minors) Tournaments.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBut if you‚Äôre stepping into a team-based format like Minor League Pickleball or the DUPR Collegiate Pickleball Tour, buckle up‚Äîthose games are usually rally scoring, go to 21 points, win by 2. The pace is different, strategy shifts, and staying focused for longer rallies becomes even more important.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat Does 4-2-2 Even Mean? The Doubles Scoring System Explained\n\n‚Äç\n\nDoubles pickleball has a scoring system that confuses a lot of players at first‚Äîbut once it clicks, it‚Äôs easy.\n\nThe score is always called out in three numbers. Like this:¬†\n\n4-2-2\n\n\n\nHere‚Äôs the breakdown:\n\nFirst number = the serving team‚Äôs score\n\n\nSecond number = the receiver team‚Äôs score\n\n\nThird number (only for doubles)= the server number (1 or 2)\n\n\n\nSo if your team is serving 4-2-2, it means:\n\n‚Äç\nYour team has 4 points, your opponents have 2, and it‚Äôs the second server‚Äôs turn.\n\n‚Äç\n\nüß† Be aware: At the very start of the game, the first server only gets one chance (so the third number is called out as ‚Äú2‚Äù). After that, both players on each team get a turn to serve at least twice before it‚Äôs a side-out.\n\n‚Äç\n\n5. Line Calls\n\n‚Äç\n\nA ball is in if it touches the line. If there‚Äôs doubt? The benefit goes to your opponent. That‚Äôs not just sportsmanship‚Äîit‚Äôs in the rulebook. When in doubt, don‚Äôt call it out ‚Ä¶\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nUnless it's a serve landing on the kitchen line. In that case, you can call it out.\n\n‚Äç\n\n6. Double Hits\n\n‚Äç\n\nLegal only if they happen during one continuous motion. If you swing once and the ball hits your paddle twice, no problem. But two distinct hits? Fault.\n\n‚Äç\n\n7. Faults\n\n‚Äç\n\nThese include:\n\nHitting the ball out of bounds\nYour serve landing on the kitchen line\n\n\nVolleys from inside the kitchen\n\n\nNot adhering to the two-bounce rule\n\n\nTouching the net or crossing the plane before the ball does. Yep, touching the net is a big no-no. If you, your partner, or your paddle hit the net‚Äîeven by accident‚Äîyou lose the point, no matter where the ball landed.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Rule Most People Get Wrong: The ‚ÄúMomentum Rule‚Äù in the Kitchen\n\n‚Äç\n\nYou hit a volley just outside the kitchen. It lands. You step forward into the kitchen. Legal?\n\n‚Äç\n\nNope. If your momentum carries you into the kitchen after a volley, even if the ball is long gone, it‚Äôs still a fault. This is one of the most commonly missed (and misunderstood) rules‚Äîeven by experienced players.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFAQs about Pickleball Rules\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ùì What is the two-bounce rule in pickleball?\n\nEach side must let the ball bounce once before hitting a volley. It applies to the serve and the return only.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ùì Can I ever step in the kitchen?\n\nYes‚Äîbut only if you‚Äôre not volleying. You can hit a dink inside the kitchen, but the ball must bounce first.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ùì Do I get a second serve if I fault the first one?\n\nNope. In pickleball, you only get one serve attempt.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ùì Is the line in or out?\n\nIf the ball touches the line, it‚Äôs in.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ùì Can I hit the ball with both hands?\n\nYes. Two-handed backhands (or forehands) are 100% legal.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy Knowing the Rules Can Improve Your Pickleball Rating\n\n‚Äç\n\nEvery DUPR match you play is logged and analyzed by our Elo algorithm. That means every point‚Äîevery rule followed or broken‚Äîimpacts your pickleball rating. If you're losing points to faults that could've been avoided, you're literally giving away your rating.\n\n‚Äç\n\nClean play = cleaner wins = a more accurate DUPR score.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThink of it this way: knowing the rules gives you a competitive edge. It‚Äôs like upgrading your paddle without spending a cent.\n\n‚Äç\n\nReady to Level Up?\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe more you know the rules, the more confident‚Äîand competitive‚Äîyou‚Äôll be. And if you want to keep improving, your next step is signing up for tournaments, outsmarting every other player with your knowledge on the Pickleball Rulebook.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nCreate your free DUPR account, log your matches, and start climbing. Whether you're a 3.0 player or aiming to be the next Ben Johns (7.41), your journey starts with knowing the game inside and out.\n\n‚Äç"}

Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or an advanced player, tournaments and leagues provide the perfect opportunity to test your skills, meet new players, and boost your pickleball rating.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBut how do pickleball tournaments and leagues work? How do you find the right event for your skill level? And, what role does DUPR play in it all? The DUPR Events Dashboard is your go-to place for every pickleball tournament and event. With just a few taps, you can browse upcoming competitions, from rating sessions to team-based leagues, and find the perfect match for your skill level. Your pickleball rating automatically updates as you play, ensuring you‚Äôre always placed in the right division for fair and competitive matchups.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLet‚Äôs dive into the world of pickleball tournaments, leagues, and ratings.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleball Tournaments From Beginners to Pros: DUPR Sessions, RTMs & Minor Leagues\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR offers a structured competitive environment that allows players of all levels to participate fairly in pickleball tournaments and leagues. What are the different types of pickleball tournaments? The three key components of the featured DUPR amateur tournament series called RTM are:\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç‚Äç\n\n1. DUPR Sessions (Rating Sessions)\n\n‚Äç\n\nBefore entering into competitive tournaments, players need an accurate DUPR rating, supported by an up-to-date Reliability Score. DUPR Sessions are two-hour round-robin sessions featuring games to 11 points, with randomly assigned partners or are partnered events where you and your partner sign up together. This allows players to compete in a fair and competitive environment.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe more matches you play, the more precise your rating becomes. Even players who already have a DUPR rating should join these sessions to refine their rating, update their reliability score, and improve their game. Every match boosts your reliability score, feeding the DUPR algorithm the data points it needs to be confident about your skill level. So if you're looking to play more matches, track your progress, and level up your game, DUPR Sessions are the perfect place to start!\n\n‚Äç\n\nThese sessions are generally divided into the following DUPR skill levels:\n\nBeginner to 3.000\n3.000 - 3.499¬†\n3.500 - 3.999¬†\n4.000 - 4.499¬†\n4.500+¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nWith the flexibility of offering either partnered or no fixed partner options, these rating sessions make for an easy entry point for players looking to participate in match play and establish or improve their DUPR rating and Reliability Score before joining other competitive events. The more matches you play, the more accurate your rating becomes.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhere can I find DUPR rating sessions and How to Register?\n\nDownload the DUPR App from the App Store or Google Play.\nCreate a DUPR Account for FREE and complete your player profile.\nSearch for DUPR Sessions near you to establish a rating. Each DUPR Rating Level is posted as a separate tournament.\nPlay Matches‚ÄîYour results will update your DUPR rating automatically.\nCheck Your Rating anytime through the app and find tournaments that match your skill level.\n\n‚Äç\n\n2. DUPR Road To Minors (RTM) Tournaments\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat are RTM tournaments in pickleball? Once you have a DUPR rating, you can enter DUPR Road to Minors (RTM) Tournaments, which are regional team-based competitions.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nThese events are structured as doubles competitions, featuring men‚Äôs, women‚Äôs, and mixed divisions. Players must have a partner to participate, but partners can change from tournament to tournament, allowing for flexibility in team selection. Unlike traditional team-based rankings, points are accrued individually, meaning your performance in each event directly impacts your standing. There is no minimum or maximum number of RTM tournaments you can enter, making it an excellent opportunity to compete as often as you like. The more tournaments you play‚Äîand win‚Äîthe more points you earn, helping you boost your DUPR ratings and qualify for higher-level competitions.\n\n‚Äç\n\nRTM Tournaments are also divided by level:¬†‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nBeginner to 3.000\n3.000 - 3.499¬†\n3.500 - 3.999¬†\n4.000 - 4.499¬†\n4.500+¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nWinning in RTM tournaments helps players qualify for the RTM Cup, where top players compete for coveted Minor League Pickleball team spots.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n3. Minor League Pickleball DUPR Divisions: How DUPR Ratings Determine Your Placement\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor players looking to compete in structured team-based leagues, Minor League Pickleball provides the next level of play. The Minor League Pickleball League is structured using DUPR divisions, ensuring competitive and fair matchups based on player ratings. Each division has a maximum aggregate rating, which is the combined DUPR rating of all players on a team. Additionally, to prevent sandbagging, each division has a maximum individual player rating cap, meaning highly skilled players cannot drop down into lower divisions.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHere‚Äôs how the divisions are structured:\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR 12 ‚Äì Team‚Äôs total DUPR must be 12.300 or lower\n\nNo individual player can have a DUPR higher than 3.600 to play in DUPR 12.\nDUPR 14 ‚Äì Team‚Äôs total DUPR must be 14.300 or lower\n\nNo individual player can have a DUPR higher than 4.100 to play in DUPR 14.\nDUPR 16 ‚Äì Team‚Äôs total DUPR must be 16.300 or lower\n\nNo individual player can have a DUPR higher than 4.600 to play in DUPR 16.\nDUPR 18 ‚Äì Team‚Äôs total DUPR must be 18.300 or lower\n\nNo individual player can have a DUPR higher than 5.100 to play in DUPR 18.¬†\nDUPR 20 ‚Äì Team‚Äôs total DUPR must be 20.999 or lower (or 20.300 if DUPR 22 is available in that region)\n\n‚ÄçDUPR 22 ‚Äì Available only in select markets and special events, with a max team aggregate of 22.999.\n\n\n\nTeams can be made up of various player combinations as long as their total does not exceed the division limit. For example, a ¬†DUPR 20 team could consist of four players rated 5.00 (5+5+5+5=20) or a mix like 5.50, 4.50, 4.75, and 5.25 (=20).\n\n‚Äç\n\nThese division limits ensure that players compete against opponents with similar skill levels, keeping matches fair and exciting. If you're looking to join a Minor League Pickleball team, your DUPR rating will determine which division you can play in.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPlayers who perform well in Minor League Pickleball Tournaments may qualify for the Minor League Pickleball National Championship.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow to Find Pickleball Tournaments Near You\n\n‚Äç\n\nIf you‚Äôre eager to start competing, here‚Äôs how to find the right tournament:\n\nUse the DUPR App for Android or Apple phones‚Äì Search for upcoming tournaments, leagues, and DUPR sessions.\nCheck Local Clubs ‚Äì Many clubs host sanctioned DUPR tournaments.\nFollow DUPR Social Media ‚Äì Stay updated on new events at @duprpb on Instagram.\nAsk Other Players ‚Äì Find a Pickleball Facebook group near you. Join a pickleball community and connect with other players.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow to Get Rated Before a Tournament\n\n‚Äç\n\nBefore entering a tournament, you need an accurate DUPR rating. You can either sign up for a DUPR Session or manually log your recreational match results.

With new opportunities to track official pickleball ratings and compete in the High School Pickleball National Pathway, today‚Äôs teen athletes are more motivated‚Äîand more pressured‚Äîthan ever before.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBut here‚Äôs the thing: they‚Äôre still kids. They‚Äôre still figuring out how to manage nerves, disappointment, and the very real emotional rollercoaster of competitive sports ‚Äî all while making sure their grades don‚Äôt suffer.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAs a parent, coach, or sibling, your words matter more than you might think. One comment can either lift your teen up‚Ä¶ or stick with them in the worst way.\n\n‚Äç\n\nYou‚Äôre Not the One Playing‚ÄîAnd That‚Äôs Okay\n\nIt‚Äôs easy to have strong opinions when you‚Äôre watching from the sidelines. Maybe they missed a shot they normally make. Maybe they didn‚Äôt seem aggressive enough. Maybe their partner didn‚Äôt play well and it threw them off. We get it‚Äîit‚Äôs frustrating to watch, especially when you care.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBut here‚Äôs the truth: there are so many factors in a pickleball match that are invisible‚Äîmental pressure, teammate chemistry, even just a bad day. Reacting as if you were the one competing only adds more stress.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBe mindful of your body language before, during, and after your child‚Äôs pickleball match. Try to stay present‚Äîavoid distractions like checking your phone, shouting from the sidelines, or showing visible frustration or discomfort, like covering your face or turning away.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nYour job isn‚Äôt to be a coach (unless you actually are one). Your job is to support, guide, and help your teen learn how to manage both victory and defeat.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy Tough Losses Matter More Than Wins\n\nTough losses tend to stick with us longer than big wins‚Äîand there‚Äôs actually a psychological reason for that. Our brains are wired to hold onto negative experiences more than positive ones. It‚Äôs called negativity bias, and it‚Äôs a natural part of how we process emotions. We‚Äôre more likely to replay a loss in our minds than to relive the high of a win.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor high school athletes, this can be especially true. A match that didn‚Äôt go well might feel like it defines their whole season‚Äîor affects how they view themselves as a player.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBut here‚Äôs the flip side: because losses tend to stick with us longer, they often become the most valuable learning experiences. What makes the difference is how we respond to them.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHelp your teen understand that one tough match doesn‚Äôt erase all their progress‚Äîor their potential. Even the best players have off days, and no single result will define their pickleball rating or future in the sport. Plus, if your child plays in tournaments regularly, their reliability score improves‚Äîmeaning their rating is less likely to swing drastically after one loss.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat matters most isn‚Äôt the outcome‚Äîit‚Äôs how they respond the next time they step on the court.\n\n‚Äç\n\nShould You Say Something‚Ä¶ or Not?\n\nYou might be asking:\n\n‚ÄúShould I talk to my kid after the match?‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhat if my kid doesn‚Äôt want me to watch him play?‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhat if my kid always blames his doubles partner after a loss?‚Äù\n‚ÄúHow should I handle it when my kid starts throwing or breaking their pickleball paddle after a tough match?\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nThere‚Äôs no perfect script, but there are better ways to approach these situations. Start by recognizing that your teen is trying to figure it out just like you are. Be the steady presence they can rely on.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat to Say and What Not to Say\n\nLet‚Äôs walk through a few scenarios and how to respond:\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe High School Pickleball National Pathway: Big Dreams Start Here\n\nThe High School Pickleball National Championship was designed to give student-athletes across the country a chance to compete at the national level. As they play more sanctioned matches and build their DUPR pickleball ratings, teens are developing real goals, accountability, and a deeper love for the game.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBut it‚Äôs not just about the rating. It‚Äôs about helping young players grow into confident, emotionally mature individuals‚Äîwho can win with humility and lose with perspective.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFinal Thoughts for Parents\n\nEvery high school athlete will experience a tough loss at some point. What matters most is how we, as the adults in their corner, respond.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBe their safe space. Let them feel what they‚Äôre feeling. And remind them that no single match defines who they are‚Äîor where they‚Äôre headed.\n\n‚Äç\n\nSupport them, believe in them, and help them see the big picture. Because in the end, it‚Äôs not just about improving pickleball ratings‚Äîit‚Äôs about raising strong, resilient young people.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe most confident athletes aren‚Äôt the ones who‚Äôve never lost‚Äîthey‚Äôre the ones who keep showing up, learning from every mistake, and trusting themselves through every setback.\n\n‚Äç\n\nEvery tournament is a chance to grow. Encourage your teen to stay in the game, even when it‚Äôs hard. That‚Äôs how champions‚Äîon and off the court‚Äîare made.\n\n‚Äç"}

However, thanks to the dedication of Hosea Randrianarivony, that is beginning to change.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHosea, a pastor originally from Madagascar, has taken it upon himself to introduce the sport to his home country. His journey is not just about sports‚Äîit‚Äôs about community, leadership, and providing opportunities for a nation eager to embrace something new.\n\n‚Äç\n\nA Journey Rooted in Faith and Service\n\n‚Äç\n\nHosea‚Äôs journey to bringing pickleball to Madagascar began long before he even picked up a paddle. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm originally from Madagascar. So, that‚Äôs where I am from. I was born and raised there. About nine years ago is when I came to America mostly to get married because I‚Äôm a pastor,‚Äù he shared. His service extended beyond the church, as he and his wife worked with Mercy Ships, a hospital organization that provides free surgeries to underserved communities.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHosea‚Äôs work in Madagascar continued even after moving to the United States. He maintained his connection to his homeland by organizing annual pastor conferences. ‚ÄúFor the past five years, we‚Äôve been going to Madagascar every single year to do pastors‚Äô conferences and teach pastors to be better leaders,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDiscovering Pickleball and Taking It Home\n\n‚Äç\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt until March 2023 that Hosea first discovered pickleball, but he quickly saw its potential for Madagascar. ‚ÄúLast year was the first time that I thought, why don‚Äôt I bring pickleball to Madagascar?‚Äù he recalled. So, he did just that. With the support of his church and community, he gathered nets, paddles, and balls to take back home. ‚ÄúMostly, I‚Äôve been given nets and paddles and balls to bring to Madagascar,‚Äù he explained. ‚Äúright now in my studio, I possibly have up to 30 paddles.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nHis goal is to not only introduce the sport but also organize structured leagues and tournaments. ‚ÄúThis year, I‚Äôm trying to bring medals and do a small league and a small tournament. I‚Äôm looking for 36 people for this year because I don‚Äôt have a lot of time in Madagascar. I‚Äôll have six weeks, but during those six weeks, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm aiming for,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Challenge and the Opportunity\n\n‚Äç\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles to growing pickleball in Madagascar is the lack of resources. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure if Madagascar is the poorest country in the world right now, but it is at least in the top five poorest countries in the world,‚Äù Hosea pointed out. ‚ÄúSo I just tell them that Madagascar has been behind in most things, and there is this one opportunity in sports.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor Hosea, pickleball isn‚Äôt just a game‚Äîit‚Äôs an avenue for growth and development. ‚ÄúThe people are so talented and smart, so I was like, there‚Äôs this opportunity that could help us to be equal or possibly be better at something with the world.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nAnother challenge is the infrastructure. Madagascar lacks dedicated pickleball courts, so Hosea has had to get creative. ‚ÄúEven at my church, we‚Äôve been using painter‚Äôs tape for the lines. We went on a tennis court, which we do here in Arlington, and then we put the tapes on. That‚Äôs what I will be doing for now.‚Äù But he remains optimistic, believing that as interest grows, solutions will arise. ‚ÄúMadagascan people are very creative. They will be able to make something to be used as a net in Madagascar.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nBuilding a Pickleball Community in Madagascar\n\n‚Äç\n\nHosea‚Äôs work in Madagascar extends beyond just sports. He is heavily involved in mentoring young people, particularly college students, through a group he helped create called It‚Äôs Time for Madagascar. ‚ÄúOne of the things It‚Äôs Time for Madagascar does is just take the initiative to do something,‚Äù he explained. The group has engaged in community service projects such as teaching languages, cleaning beaches, and even visiting prisons. Now, it‚Äôs also pioneering the introduction of pickleball to the island.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor Hosea, the key to pickleball‚Äôs success in Madagascar will be education and accessibility. ‚ÄúWe may think getting a phone like this is easy‚Äù, he says pointing at his phone, ‚Äúbut it costs a fortune in Madagascar. Most people pay the exact same price as Americans pay, but it‚Äôs a year of salary for most people in Madagascar.‚Äù This makes organizing a structured league with digital tracking a challenge. His plan? Have organizers manually keep track of scores and ratings to ensure fair competition with DUPR.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLooking to the Future\n\n‚Äç\n\nDespite the challenges, Hosea remains hopeful and committed to growing the sport in Madagascar. ‚ÄúI started learning pickleball and I went mostly from zero to a hundred. I was not really interested in pickleball‚ÄîI just wanted to be able to help the people that really love playing,‚Äù he said. But what started as a way to serve others has turned into a passion of its own.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAs he prepares for his upcoming trip, Hosea envisions a bright future for pickleball in Madagascar. With ongoing support from his church, the pickleball community, and donors, Hosea believes Madagascar can become a stronghold for the sport. ‚ÄúI believe once people see it and get used to the game, it‚Äôs going to be awesome, and during these upcoming 6 weeks, I will be able to grow it.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nThrough faith, perseverance, and a deep love for his home country, Hosea Randrianarivony is not just introducing a sport to Madagascar‚Äîhe‚Äôs creating a movement. A movement of inclusivity, opportunity, and hope, one paddle at a time.\n\n‚Äç"}

With fresh rule changes, expanded rosters, and new talent, the 2025 season promises excitement. We‚Äôve just concluded the Premier and Challenger Free Agency Draft picks, so new faces will soon emerge in the pro pickleball space.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLet‚Äôs get into those updates.\n\n‚Äç\n\nMajor Rule Changes\nUPA Players Eligibility: Noncontracted UPA players are NOT eligible for the 2025 draft. Around 12 players (4 men, 8 women) from 2024 will not return.\nExpanded Premier Team Rosters: Teams now have 6 players (3 men, 3 women) instead of 4, with 5th & 6th picks as subs who can also be picked up by another team into their starting lineup during the four waiver periods.\nScoring Change: No more rally scoring! Matches will now use side-out scoring, one game to 11.\nMandatory Player Drop: Each team must drop one player from their 2024 roster.\n\nAlright, that‚Äôs enough rules. There are more rule changes to this season, but I‚Äôd say those are your biggest ones.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nMLP Roster Updates\n\nNow for the fun part: I hope you were able to check in either March 2nd or 3rd for the Premier and Challenger draft picks because it was an interesting one! Of course I did because yes, pickleball is life. With the expansion of the roster sizes, we will be seeing new names.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, the Premier and Challenger drafts introduced 34 new players (27 Premier, 7 Challenger) who didn‚Äôt play in MLP 2024. Some are returning from injury, some have been dominant in PPA tournaments, and others are new to pickleball.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThere is a great deal of talent at the 5th and 6th spot who could easily be a steal into a starting role within a Premier team. I am curious how they truly feel being in the 5th and 6th spot of a Premier team, where they could‚Äôve easily played on a Challenger team and received playing time at every event.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nSure, it‚Äôs nice to be considered on a team with your Ben Johns and Anna Brights, but wouldn‚Äôt you just rather play instead?¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nI know I would rather play, but I guess it‚Äôs a matter of preference ‚Äî and you really don't have a choice to say no if a team were to pick you up.\n\n‚Äç\n\nKey New Players in Starting Lineups\nAtlanta Bouncers: Victoria Di Muzio ‚Äì A rising talent from Canada, but still needs time to prove herself.\nChicago Slice: Max Freeman ‚Äì PPA tour standout, strong addition.\nMiami Pickleball Club: Mya Bui ‚Äì Former D1 tennis player with a competitive edge.\nNY Hustlers: Helena Spiridis, Dominique Schaefer, Zane Ford ‚Äì Singles specialists working hard on doubles.\nSoCal Hard Eights: Ivan Jakovljevic ‚Äì A well-trained competitor from Dallas.\nUtah Black Diamonds: Mehvish Safdar ‚Äì Another D1 tennis standout and similar to Mya coming in. Both are potential dark horses here.\n\n‚Äç\n\nNotable Challenger Teams to Watch\nBrooklyn Aces vs. Las Vegas Night Owls: Expect tight dreambreakers ‚Äì slight edge to the Night Owls due to singles talent.\nNashville Chefs: Strong pickups in the draft with Scarpa and Brown and a steal of an experienced player in Esquival to pair well with Radzikowska.\nBay Area Breakers: Wyatt Stone subbed in for the Chicago Slice in the MLP Finals last year. He's underrated, but dangerous.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFull Premier Team Rosters\n\n(Sub/Bench Players in Italics; New 2025 Players in Bold)\n\n‚Äç\n\nChallenger Teams\n‚Äç\n‚ÄçFinal Thoughts\n\nWith new faces, bigger rosters, and fresh rules, 2025 is set to be an unpredictable season.

That‚Äôs exactly what the James Madison University (JMU) Pickleball Club set out to showcase in their new documentary, ‚ÄúFor the Love of the Game - The JMU Pickleball Nationals Experience.‚Äù Having premiered on January 22, 2025, this video offers an inside look at the trials, triumphs, and tenacity of JMU‚Äôs team as they took on the best in the nation at the 2024 DUPR¬†Collegiate National Championship.\n\n‚Äç\n\nMore Than Just Singles and Doubles\n\n‚Äç\n\nCollegiate pickleball's format adds layers of strategy and teamwork. A team consists of four players‚Äîtwo men and two women‚Äîcompeting against each other. Each match begins with a women‚Äôs doubles, then follows a men‚Äôs doubles game, and by two mixed doubles matches\n\n¬†\n\nIf the teams split 2-2, it all comes down to a ‚ÄúDreambreaker‚Äù, a high-stakes team singles match where players rotate every four points. As JMU's Team member, Ryan Morneau, put it,\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúEven if you have a really, really good player, you need the whole team to be there to really exchange these matches.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nJMU‚Äôs Unique Vibe: Energy, Passion, and a Little Bit of Chaos\n\n‚Äç\n\nJMU brings an energy that often sets them apart from the competition. Their players embrace a culture that thrives on excitement, passion, and an undeniable presence on the court. From the sidelines to the final point, they‚Äôre loud, engaged, and always supporting their teammates.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor them, pickleball isn‚Äôt just about winning; it‚Äôs about creating an atmosphere where energy fuels performance and every match feels like an event. Their approach has helped build a team identity that stands out in collegiate pickleball, making them one of the most talked-about programs in the sport.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThat same enthusiasm, however, can also make them a target. Their relentless support and high-energy approach aren‚Äôt always well-received by opponents who prefer a quieter, more traditional competitive environment. Some teams see JMU‚Äôs presence as overwhelming, even frustrating, leading to a natural rivalry dynamic.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhether loved or disliked, one thing is certain‚ÄîJMU leaves an impression, and their impact on the court is impossible to ignore.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nJMU's Journey at The 2024 DUPR Collegiate National Championship\n\n‚Äç\n\nJMU started Nationals with nerves high, struggling early against Purdue. Costly mistakes in doubles and mixed doubles led to a tough loss.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúWe lost that match, and it was on me,‚Äù said Morneau. Despite a strong fight in the Dreambreaker, they fell 21-18.\n\n‚Äç\n\nRegrouping, JMU bounced back with a win, using it to sharpen their game before the elimination rounds. The depth of their 20-player roster proved crucial, emphasizing team chemistry beyond just skill.\n\nJMU‚Äôs final showdown was against their biggest rivals, Virginia Tech. With Tech‚Äôs new star player, the match carried extra intensity. JMU fell behind 20-8, but refused to quit, rallying to 20-19 in a stunning comeback. However, a missed serve on match point sealed the loss.\n\nThough they fell short, JMU left Nationals knowing they could compete with the best‚Äîand with confidence that next time, they‚Äôd be ready to win.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Future of Collegiate Pickleball\n\n‚Äç\n\nJMU‚Äôs experience at Nationals highlights the rapid growth of collegiate pickleball. The event also highlighted the rapid rise of collegiate pickleball, with 64 teams competing‚Äîa number set to double next year, thanks to growing support from DUPR and the PPA. As more schools join the competition, the sport is evolving beyond just a club activity. With its rising popularity, many believe it‚Äôs only a matter of time before scholarships and NIL deals become a reality. The increase in teams from year to year shows just how quickly the sport is expanding, outpacing traditional college tennis events in size and excitement.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor the Love of the Game ‚Äì The JMU Pickleball Nationals Experience\" captures the dedication and resilience of a team pushing the limits of collegiate pickleball. More than just a tournament, it‚Äôs a look at a fast-growing sport and the players driving its momentum. Watch the full documentary here.\n\n‚Äç"}

If you‚Äôve been considering creating a portable pickleball court for your own home or recreational space, this guide is for you. From understanding pickleball court dimensions to selecting the best court equipment, we‚Äôll walk you through everything you need to know about setting up and maintaining a court that‚Äôs both functional and fun.\n\nWhat is a Portable Pickleball Court?\n\nA portable pickleball court is an adaptable, easily assembled setup that allows you to enjoy the game without the commitment of a permanent structure. Whether you have a small backyard, a park, or a community center at your disposal, a portable court provides flexibility for playing on the go. Its ease of setup and takedown makes it ideal for those who want to enjoy pickleball wherever they choose.\n\n‚Äç\n\nUnderstanding the Right Pickleball Court Dimensions\n\nBefore you begin your pickleball court construction, it's crucial to understand the appropriate pickleball court dimensions. A standard court measures 20 feet wide by 44 feet long for both singles and doubles play. However, if you‚Äôre working with limited space, it‚Äôs possible to adjust the size of your court using portable boundary lines that will allow for a more customized experience.\n\nWhen designing your setup, ensure there is enough room for movement while still maintaining an enjoyable, competitive environment. A balance between size and usability is key to creating the perfect space for pickleball.\n\n‚Äç\n\nKey Elements of Pickleball Court Construction\n\nThe core components of a pickleball court revolve around creating a safe and enjoyable environment. One of the most important aspects is the pickleball court surface. While traditional courts are often made from concrete or asphalt, portable options may use materials such as synthetic turf or rubber tiles. These surfaces offer both durability and comfort, ensuring a smooth and safe experience for players of all skill levels.\n\nIn terms of construction, a pickleball court design generally incorporates lightweight materials like PVC for easy assembly. A removable pickleball court net, boundary lines, and markings replicate the feel of a traditional court, creating an authentic playing experience.\n\n‚Äç\n\nChoosing the Right Pickleball Court Net\n\nA quality pickleball court net is a crucial component of your setup. Look for nets that are both adjustable and sturdy enough to withstand outdoor conditions. Nylon or polyester nets are commonly used because they stay taut during play and are resistant to weather damage. Official net height specifications are 36 inches at the sidelines and 34 inches at the center.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre a competitive player or just looking to have fun, the right net ensures that your games stay on track and your setup remains functional.\n\n‚Äç\n\nEssential Pickleball Court Equipment\n\nBeyond the net, there are a few other essential pieces of pickleball court equipment to complete your setup. Paddles, pickleballs, and proper footwear are key to an optimal game. Paddles come in various materials, such as wood, composite, and graphite, while pickleballs are specifically designed for either indoor or outdoor play.\n\nInvesting in high-quality equipment will not only improve your game but also ensure that your pickleball court stands the test of time, providing years of enjoyment.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Process of Pickleball Court Installation\n\nSetting up a portable pickleball court doesn‚Äôt need to be complicated. Start by selecting a flat, level area that‚Äôs free from debris. Use adjustable boundary markers to outline the dimensions of the court. The pickleball court net should be set up with adjustable height settings, and you can enhance the surface with materials like rubber tiles or artificial grass if needed.\n\nIf you‚Äôre unsure about the process, many companies that sell portable courts provide video tutorials or easy-to-follow guides for installation.\n\n‚Äç\n\nMaintaining Your Pickleball Court\n\nPickleball court maintenance is essential for keeping your court in top shape. Regularly check the pickleball court surface for wear and tear, particularly if you‚Äôre using synthetic materials or tiles. Clean your pickleball court net to prevent dirt buildup and ensure it remains taut throughout gameplay. Boundary markers should also be inspected periodically to make sure they‚Äôre still correctly positioned.\n\nFor outdoor courts, be mindful of the weather. When not in use, store your equipment in a safe, dry place to protect it from harsh conditions, extending the life of your court and accessories.\n\n‚Äç\n\nMust-Have Pickleball Court Accessories\n\nTo make your court even more functional, consider investing in a few pickleball court accessories. Boundary line markers are crucial for creating accurate court dimensions, especially in a portable setup. A portable scoreboard is another great addition, helping you keep track of scores during competitive play.\n\nOther accessories, such as storage solutions for paddles and balls, or outdoor lighting for nighttime games, can significantly enhance your experience. These accessories ensure that you‚Äôre always ready for a fun and competitive match.\n\n‚Äç\n\nConclusion\n\nCreating a portable pickleball court at home is a great way to enjoy the sport without needing a permanent facility. By understanding the right pickleball court dimensions, using the proper court equipment, and maintaining the right pickleball court surface, you can build a setup that suits your needs. Adding essential pickleball court accessories and investing time in court maintenance will ensure that your court remains functional for years to come.\n\nWhether you're just getting into pickleball or you're a seasoned player, a portable court gives you the flexibility to play wherever and whenever you want. Happy playing!\n\n‚Äç"}

But hope isn‚Äôt a strategy.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTo compete at the highest level, you need a structured plan‚Äîone that identifies your weaknesses, maximizes your strengths, and creates a clear path for growth.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThat‚Äôs where an Individual Development Plan (IDP) comes in.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis article will show you how to build your own IDP to systematically improve, train with purpose, and elevate your performance on the court.\n\n‚Äç\n\nUnderstanding the Pickleball Performance Model\n\nMany players focus on the wrong things. They drill the same shots over and over but neglect the bigger picture of what makes a complete athlete.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTo compete at an elite level, you need to develop in five key areas:\n\n‚Äç\n\nPhysical Performance ‚Äì Your endurance, strength, speed, and recovery determine whether you can play at a high level for an entire match, or even a multi-day tournament.\nPsychological Performance ‚Äì The ability to handle pressure, stay focused, and bounce back after mistakes separates good players from great ones.\nIntellectual Performance ‚Äì Your daily habits, nutrition, hydration, sleep, and ability to learn from mistakes directly impact your energy and decision-making.\nTechnical Performance ‚Äì Your strokes must be consistent, efficient, and effective under game conditions.\nTactical Performance ‚Äì It‚Äôs not just about hitting great shots; you need to choose the right shot at the right time, anticipate opponents‚Äô moves, and adapt on the fly.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy This Matters: Ignoring any of these areas creates weaknesses in your game. The best players recognize their gaps and have a plan to improve all five.\n\n‚Äç\n\nNext, let‚Äôs assess where you currently stand in each of these areas.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAssessing Yourself ‚Äì Where Do You Stand Today?\n\nMost players think they know their strengths and weaknesses‚Äîbut without a structured self-assessment, they‚Äôre just guessing.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe problem? Blind spots.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTo improve quickly, you need a clear picture of what‚Äôs holding you back. Here‚Äôs how to do it:\n\n‚Äç\n\nStep 1: Rate Yourself (1-4 Scale)\n\n1 ‚Äì Needs Improvement | 2 ‚Äì Sufficient | 3 ‚Äì Excellent | 4 ‚Äì Outstanding\nScore yourself on physical endurance, focus under pressure, shot consistency, positioning, and other key areas.\n\nStep 2: Get a Coach or Skilled Third Party‚Äôs Input\n\nThey will see things you can‚Äôt.\nA coach can confirm if your self-assessment is accurate or highlight areas you overlooked.\n\nStep 3: Answer This Question:\n‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt achieve my potential, it will be because of ______.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy This Matters: This simple question forces you to confront your biggest limitations‚Äîso you can start fixing them.\n\nOnce you‚Äôve identified your weaknesses, it‚Äôs time to prioritize what matters most.\n\n‚Äç\n\nSetting Priorities ‚Äì What Areas Need the Most Work?\n\nTrying to fix everything at once leads to frustration and slow progress.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe key? Laser-focus on 2-3 areas that will give you the biggest improvement.\n\n‚Äç\n\nRule #1: Prioritize Development Based on Competitive Edge\n\nWhat will most impact your game? Stamina? Shot consistency? Shot selection?\n\nRule #2: Never Neglect Your Strengths\n\nDouble down on what you‚Äôre best at. If your forehand drive is elite, make it unstoppable.\n\nRule #3: Set SMART Goals\n\nSpecific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound\nExample: Instead of \"get better at dinks,\" say, \"Improve dink consistency to 80% in live drills within 4 weeks.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy This Matters: Clear priorities = faster improvement. A scattered approach gets scattered results.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWith your priorities set, let‚Äôs build your Individual Development Plan.\n\n‚Äç\n\nSection 4: Building Your Individual Development Plan (IDP)\n\nA great plan is simple and actionable.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHere‚Äôs how to structure your IDP:\n\n‚Äç\n\nStep 1: Identify Specific Action Steps for Each Weakness\n\nPhysical ‚Äì Increase endurance ‚Üí Add structured conditioning drills\nMental ‚Äì Improve focus ‚Üí Develop pre-match mental routines\nTechnical ‚Äì More consistent third-shot drops ‚Üí Focused drill sessions\nTactical ‚Äì Better doubles positioning ‚Üí Film study & strategy work\n\nStep 2: Implement a Feedback Loop\n\nRegular check-ins with a coach or mentor\nTracking progress over weeks/months\n\nStep 3: Adjust & Adapt Over Time\n\nPerformance isn‚Äôt linear‚Äîsome skills take longer to improve.\nBe flexible but stay consistent.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy This Matters: Having an IDP keeps you accountable and ensures you‚Äôre training with purpose instead of just playing more matches.\n\n‚Äç\n\nNow that you have a plan, how do you execute it consistently?\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow to Execute & Stay Consistent\n\nThe best plan means nothing if you don‚Äôt stick to it.\n\n‚Äç\n\nMost players start strong but lose focus over time. Here‚Äôs how to stay on track:\n\n‚Äç\n\nRule #1: Use the 80/20 Rule of Training\n\n80% of your time should go toward your biggest growth areas.\n20% should reinforce strengths.\n\nRule #2: Build Accountability into Your Plan\n\nCheck-in weekly with a coach or training partner.\nTrack progress in a training journal.\n\nRule #3: Use Competition as a Testing Ground\n\nApply training under real match conditions.\nWatch game film to see progress and adjust strategy.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy This Matters: Players who train with a system and accountability make massive progress. Those who just \"play more\" stay stuck.\n\nLet‚Äôs wrap it up.\n\n‚Äç\n\nElevate Your Game with a Proactive Approach\n\nThe difference between good and great players is not talent.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIt‚Äôs intentional development.\n\n‚Äç\n\nYour IDP is your roadmap to success. Use it, refine it, and watch your game evolve.\n\n‚Äç\n\nNext Step: Start your assessment today. Identify your weaknesses, build your plan, and take control of your development.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nYour success starts now.

While doubles drills help build teamwork and strategy, incorporating singles-specific drills into your training routine can give you a competitive edge. Listen to these tips from Pro player Bobbi Oshiro.\n\n‚Äç\n\nOne of my go-to singles drills is called ISOS. This dynamic exercise requires two players and focuses on endurance, accuracy, and efficient movement around the court.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow to Perform the ISOS Drill\n\nStarting Positions:\n\nPlayer A begins on one side of the court, either the right or left.\nPlayer B starts in the middle of the court.\nDrill Execution:\n\nPlayer A alternates between hitting cross-court and down-the-line shots.\nPlayer B‚Äôs goal is to return each shot back to Player A‚Äôs side, focusing on controlled and balanced strokes.\nThe key is maintaining consistency, hitting accurate targets, and recovering quickly after each shot.\nDrill Goal:\n\nPlayer B must successfully return 10 balls before switching roles.\n\nThis drill is a fantastic way to simulate real singles play, as it trains you to stay balanced while hitting on the run and improves your ability to recover efficiently between shots. Plus, it‚Äôs an incredible workout that will boost your endurance and sharpen your groundstrokes.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy Singles Drills Matter\n\nEven if you primarily play doubles, working on singles-specific skills can improve every aspect of your game. Stronger footwork, faster reactions, and better shot placement will translate to success in all formats of pickleball.\n\n‚Äç\n\nSo next time you hit the court, challenge yourself with the ISOS drill and watch your singles (and doubles) game reach new levels.

This year, the College Team of the Year award was decided by a robust total of 5,985 votes, demonstrating the widespread enthusiasm for the sport and for UT Austin‚Äôs program.\n\n‚Äç\n\nUniversity of Texas ‚Äî Austin: 1,152 votes (19.27%)\nOhio State University: 528 votes (8.83%)\nUniversity of Florida: 509 votes (8.51%)\nUNC Chapel Hill: 493 votes (8.25%)\nUtah Tech: 458 votes (7.66%)\nUniversity of Southern California: 418 votes (6.99%)\nFlorida Atlantic University: 394 votes (6.59%)\nUniversity of Virginia: 372 votes (6.22%)\nVirginia Tech: 330 votes (5.52%)\nPurdue University: 235 votes (3.93%)\nSamford University: 230 votes (3.85%)\nIndiana University: 215 votes (3.60%)\nNorth Carolina State University: 156 votes (2.61%)\nUtah State University: 154 votes (2.58%)\nClemson University: 148 votes (2.48%)\nUtah Valley University: 144 votes (2.41%)\n\n‚Äç\n\nUT Austin clearly came out on top by capturing nearly 20% of all votes. That shows the program's big influence and the amazing support from its community.\n\n‚Äç\n\nA Culture Built on Loyalty and Fun\n\nThe secret to UT Austin‚Äôs success lies in the team‚Äôs unique culture and deep-rooted loyalty. The program has fostered an environment where every member‚Äîfrom students to alumni‚Äîfeels a profound connection to the team and the school. This enduring loyalty has been a cornerstone of their identity, both on and off the court.\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"What sets us apart is the unwavering loyalty our students, alumni, and friends have for our school and our team, which truly means a lot to us,‚Äù said UT Austin team captain, Jack Munro.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis commitment goes beyond winning matches; it creates a family-like atmosphere where team dinners, social nights with DJs and food, and mandatory gatherings are all part of building lasting bonds. These events have helped solidify a culture that values both excellence in competition and camaraderie off the court.\n\n‚Äç\n\nMemorable Victories and the Role of Key Players\n\nThe UT Austin team has experienced several unforgettable moments during the season, with one particular victory standing out as a turning point. The win at the Collegiate Individual Nationals not only put the team on the map but also created a legacy that continues to inspire the program.¬†\n\n\"Timmy was vital to win collegiate thenationals last year. I owe everything to Timmy. He saved seven match points,‚Äù Munro emphasized.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis highlights the pivotal role that individual performances can play in lifting the entire team. Even as players graduate and move on to new opportunities, their contributions remain a lasting part of the team‚Äôs identity, symbolized by the banner proudly displayed at Urban Pickleball.¬†\n\nSuch victories not only boost the team's confidence but also cement their reputation as one of the premier collegiate pickleball programs in the nation.\n\nOvercoming the Challenges of Collegiate Pickleball\n\nRunning a collegiate pickleball program comes with a unique set of challenges, and UT Austin‚Äôs journey has been a testament to learning through trial and error. Without a clear blueprint for managing everything from flight bookings to scheduling practices and hosting tryouts, the team has had to innovate on the fly.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis learning process has involved seeking advice from other programs and adapting strategies to fit their unique needs.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLogistical challenges aside, the team has also faced the task of building a competitive structure from scratch. Smaller tournaments such as the Texas Super Regional and the Baylor Invitational have served as critical stepping stones.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nThese events allow the team to gauge the level of regional competition and gain valuable experience, ensuring that they are fully prepared for the national stage.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLeadership and the Importance of Team Bonding\n\nStrong leadership has been a vital component in navigating both the triumphs and trials of the season. The team‚Äôs leadership structure, which includes captains on both the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs sides, has been instrumental in maintaining focus and morale. Alongside these leaders, Coach Terry McCarthy has played an indispensable role in organizing the team, managing logistics, and providing unwavering support.\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"Leadership was huge‚Äîbeing the captain, having Zoeya Khan lead on the female side, and our coach Terry McCarthy who helped us with everything from setting up to booking flights. We owe so much to Terry; he even gave us our first jerseys when we had none,‚Äù Munro said.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis blend of strong leadership and team bonding has allowed UT Austin to maintain a balance between competitive intensity and a fun, inclusive environment. The regular team dinners, social nights, and other bonding activities have not only boosted morale but have also created an atmosphere where every member feels valued and driven to contribute to the collective success.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBuilding a Legacy for the Future\n\nWinning the College Team of the Year award is more than just a recognition of past achievements‚Äîit is a stepping stone to future success. The award is expected to strengthen the program‚Äôs case for institutional support, such as the installation of permanent pickleball courts at the university.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nSuch developments would ensure that the team continues to thrive and attract top-tier talent, further establishing UT Austin as a powerhouse in collegiate pickleball. In addition to seeking better facilities, the team has set its sights on ambitious goals for the coming seasons.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nThey aim to secure back-to-back national titles, even as they navigate changes in player partnerships and adapt to new competitive challenges. The future of UT Austin pickleball is bright, with plans to expand the team‚Äôs social presence and continue building a legacy that will inspire future generations of student-athletes.\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"[The] jobs not finished,‚Äù stressed Munro. ‚ÄúOur goal is to win another back-to-back title and keep growing our social side. It‚Äôs where you meet people, where we vibe. For kids coming to UT or getting into collegiate pickleball, it‚Äôs going to be one of the best decisions of your life.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis forward-looking vision encapsulates the team‚Äôs determination to remain at the forefront of collegiate pickleball while also nurturing a community that values both athletic excellence and personal growth.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Future Impact of UT Austin‚Äôs Success\n\nThe recognition as College Team of the Year at the Dink Awards marks a pivotal moment for the UT Austin pickleball program. This accolade is a testament to the team‚Äôs hard work, strong leadership, and the supportive community that rallies behind them. As they continue to build on this success, the program is poised to influence the broader collegiate sports landscape and pave the way for future pickleball athletes.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWith an eye on further national success and improved facilities, UT Austin is set to lead the evolution of collegiate pickleball. The program‚Äôs innovative approach, underpinned by a deep sense of loyalty and a vibrant team culture, will undoubtedly inspire new players to join and contribute to the sport.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe UT Austin pickleball team‚Äôs journey is a great example of what can be achieved with passion, perseverance, and a commitment to the community. Their recent recognition at the Dink Awards is not just a win for the team‚Äîit is a win for every member of the UT Austin community and a beacon for future generations in collegiate pickleball."}

Whether you're looking to pick it up as a casual hobby or dive deeper into the competitive side, understanding the rules of pickleball is your first step. Let‚Äôs break down the pickleball basics, explain the pickleball game rules, and share pickleball tips for beginners to help you get started. Plus, we‚Äôll introduce you to DUPR‚Äîa great way to track your progress and connect with other players!\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat is Pickleball?\n\nBefore jumping into the pickleball rules, let‚Äôs quickly explain what the game is. Pickleball is a fast-paced sport that combines elements of tennis, badminton, and table tennis. It‚Äôs played with a paddle and a perforated plastic ball, and the objective is to score points by getting the ball over the net and into the opponent's court. It can be played one-on-one or in teams of two.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow to Play Pickleball: A Beginner's Guide\n\nIf you're wondering how to play pickleball, it‚Äôs simple! The game is played on a rectangular court with a net in the middle. Here‚Äôs a quick rundown of the pickleball basics:\n\nServe: The game starts with the serve. To serve, stand behind the baseline, keep the paddle below your waist, and hit the ball diagonally into the opponent's service box. The serve must be underhand and clear the net.\nReturn: After the serve, the opponent must return the ball. This is done by hitting the ball back over the net, aiming to land it in the opponent‚Äôs court. The ball must clear the net and stay inbounds.\nRally: Once both players have hit the ball back and forth, it becomes a rally. You‚Äôll continue hitting the ball until one side fails to return it or hits it out of bounds.\nThe Kitchen: The non-volley zone near the net is called the kitchen. You can't step into the kitchen and hit the ball before it bounces unless you‚Äôre standing behind the line. This rule helps keep the game safe and strategic.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleball Rules Explained\n\nNow that you have a basic understanding, let‚Äôs dive into the pickleball game rules you need to know:\n\nScoring: Only the serving side can score points. A point is earned if the opponent faults (e.g., misses the ball, hits it out, or steps into the kitchen). Games are typically played to 11 points, and you must win by at least 2 points.\nPickleball Scoring Rules: In pickleball scoring rules, players must call out the score before each serve. The score is stated as: server score ‚Äì receiver score. For example, 3-2 means the server has 3 points, and the receiver has 2 points.\nDouble Bounce Rule: After the ball is served, it must bounce once on each side before players can volley (hit the ball in the air without a bounce). This rule makes the game more strategic.\nFaults: A fault occurs when a player makes an error, like missing the ball, hitting it out of bounds, or stepping into the kitchen. Faults result in the loss of a point or serve.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleball Tips for Beginners\n\nIf you‚Äôre just starting out, here are some pickleball tips for beginners to help you improve your game:\n\nPractice your serve: Serving is key to starting the point off right. Make sure you get comfortable with underhand serves and aim for accuracy.\nStay patient: Pickleball can be fast but try to focus on making accurate shots instead of rushing to hit the ball.\nMove your feet: Positioning yourself properly is essential. Keep your feet moving to get into the best spot for each shot.\nCommunicate in doubles: If you're playing doubles, communication with your partner is crucial. Make sure you both know who‚Äôs covering which side of the court.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTrack Your Progress with DUPR\n\nAs you start mastering the pickleball game rules and improving your skills, tracking your progress becomes important.

This historic occasion highlights the adaptability and inclusivity of pickleball, as well as the potential of the sport to inspire hope and transformation in unexpected places. At the forefront of this initiative is Angelo Rossetti, who has dedicated himself to sharing the game‚Äôs transformative power.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe First DUPR Prison Event\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR, the official global pickleball rating system, provides a fair and accurate measure of players‚Äô skill levels. It has been instrumental in uniting the pickleball community by offering a universal standard for competition and progress tracking. By bringing this system into prisons, Rossetti is breaking new ground, creating opportunities for incarcerated individuals to engage with the sport in a meaningful way.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúPickleball is more than a game; it‚Äôs a way to inspire people and bring them hope,‚Äù said Rossetti, a certified pickleball coach.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDuring tomorrow‚Äôs event, he will document games with pen and paper, following strict prison regulations that prohibit electronic devices. These results will later be entered into a DUPR digital club, preserving the anonymity of players while allowing them to track their progress. This event is a significant milestone in showcasing how pickleball‚Äôs universal rating system can bridge gaps and create connections, even within the walls of a correctional facility.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBringing Pickleball to Prisons\n\n‚Äç\n\nA year ago, Rossetti was introduced to Pickleball for the Incarcerated League (PICL), a program founded by Sarah Gerstein, one of his former students who brought PICL to the state of Connecticut. PICL‚Äôs mission is to introduce pickleball to incarcerated individuals, providing them with a constructive outlet and a sense of community. Although initially hesitant after a daunting orientation, Rossetti honored his promise to help. His first visit to a correctional facility proved transformative, solidifying his commitment to the program.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúWhen I first stepped into a prison for this program, I was intimidated. But that first session was transformative,‚Äù Rossetti shared.\n\n‚Äç\n\nRossetti now coaches at nearly all of Connecticut‚Äôs correctional institutions that can accommodate pickleball. His sessions emphasize more than just gameplay; they instill life lessons, resilience, and the power of controlling one‚Äôs attitude and effort. For many inmates, the program offers a rare source of hope and joy.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFrom Racket Sports to Pickleball Pioneer\n\n‚Äç\n\nRossetti‚Äôs journey to this moment began with a lifelong love of racket sports, nurtured by his grandfather, who built a ping-pong table in his basement. Sundays after church were spent playing table tennis with his brother, Ettore, a partnership that would become the cornerstone of his athletic journey. Transitioning to tennis in high school, Angelo played competitively for the University of Connecticut‚Äôs Division 1 team.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúPickleball clicked for me when I saw how easily different ages and levels could play together,‚Äù said Rossetti.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleball entered his life six years ago, almost serendipitously. After giving tennis lessons to his daughter‚Äôs friends, Rossetti introduced them to pickleball in his driveway. The instant connection the young players felt to the sport ignited Rossetti‚Äôs curiosity. He recognized pickleball‚Äôs unique appeal‚Äîits accessibility for players of all ages and skill levels‚Äîand decided to shift his focus from tennis to pickleball full-time.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve completed every certification out there because I want to be the best for the people I coach,‚Äù said Rossetti.\n\n‚Äç\n\nRossetti‚Äôs commitment to the sport has been extraordinary. This dedication also led to a Guinness World Record: on August 17, 2024, Rossetti and Ettore completed 10,532 consecutive volleys without a miss, raising funds for Save the Children. This accomplishment, alongside his earlier tennis world records, highlights the brothers‚Äô philosophy of blending sport with purpose.\n\n‚Äç\n\nA Family Bond Rooted in Sport\n\n‚Äç\n\nAngelo‚Äôs bond with Ettore has been instrumental in his journey. The duo‚Äôs approach to sports transcends competition. They‚Äôve always embraced the ‚Äúinfinite game‚Äù‚Äîplaying for joy, improvement, and connection rather than simply to win. Their shared experiences, from childhood table tennis matches to world record pursuits, have fostered a relationship that Rossetti describes as deeper than typical sibling ties.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my best friend, my confidant, my mentor,‚Äù Rossetti said, reflecting on his relationship with Ettore.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTheir connection has fueled many of their shared milestones, including their Guinness World Records and charity work. Ettore's unwavering support and shared love for racket sports have been a constant source of strength and motivation for Angelo. Together, they continue to push the boundaries of what can be achieved through sport, both on and off the court.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor Angelo, having Ettore by his side also means having someone to hold him accountable and challenge him to be better. It‚Äôs a relationship built on trust, mutual respect, and the joy of shared successes, making their journey even more meaningful.\n\n‚Äç\n\nInspiring Through EAGLES and Effort\n\n‚Äç\n\nRossetti‚Äôs coaching philosophy is rooted in his acronym ‚ÄúEAGLES,‚Äù which stands for Effort, Attitude, Gratitude, Learning, Enjoyment, and Sportsmanship. He shares this mantra with inmates to encourage them to focus on controllable aspects of life and to play with freedom and joy. At one correctional facility, his teachings left such an impact that inmates painted a mural of two eagles alongside the acronym, symbolizing hope and inspiration.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúFocus on your EAGLES: Effort, Attitude, Gratitude, Learning, Enjoyment, and Sportsmanship,‚Äù said Rossetti.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPhoto Credit: Tyler Russell/Connecticut Public\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe mural serves as a lasting testament to the impact Rossetti‚Äôs words and actions have had on the inmates. For many, the concept of EAGLES becomes more than just an acronym‚Äîit‚Äôs a framework for rebuilding their lives, even within the constraints of incarceration. It reminds them of their capacity to grow, adapt, and find joy in the small victories.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis philosophy also reflects Rossetti‚Äôs broader mission: to teach life lessons through pickleball. Whether on the court or in life, focusing on controllable factors helps players‚Äîand people‚Äîfind peace and purpose despite challenges.\n\n‚Äç\n\nChanging Lives with Pickleball\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhile many of the inmates Rossetti coaches may never be released, his efforts are making a tangible difference. One standout player, who is set to reenter society, represents the potential for programs like PICL to bridge the gap between incarceration and reintegration. Rossetti envisions a future where more inmates can use their pickleball skills to connect with communities outside prison walls.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúThis is about more than pickleball‚Äîit‚Äôs about changing lives,‚Äù said Rossetti.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTomorrow‚Äôs DUPR event marks a significant step forward. It not only highlights the adaptability and inclusivity of pickleball but also demonstrates how a universal rating system can foster connections in the most unexpected places. As Rossetti continues his work, his story serves as a powerful reminder of pickleball‚Äôs potential to change lives, one rally at a time.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPhoto Credit: Tyler Russell/Connecticut Public\n\n‚Äç"}

All those steps are condensed into a single press of a button at the beginning of the match. For clubs that choose to default to Submit Results for a court or event, the single button press is eliminated, and what is left is totally frictionless reporting to DUPR.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy it Matters\n\nDUPR stands for Dynamic Universal Pickleball Rating. Putting Universal in the name turned out to be prescient, as DUPR has become the universal standard for pickleball ratings.¬†\n\n>1 million players\n>5 million matches records\n>5,000 pickleball clubs and facilities\n158 countries represented\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR is a rating system designed to provide accurate and dynamic player ratings. Unlike traditional static rating systems, DUPR's algorithm continuously adjusts ratings based on match results, ensuring that ratings reflect current skill levels. DUPR's dynamic rating system unifies pickleball across age, gender, and location by analyzing match results to accurately evaluate all players across a 2.000 - 8.000 scale.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR promotes fair and balanced gameplay by accurately assessing player skill levels. Accurate and accessible ratings help drive:\n\nSkill Development. Players can track their progress and identify areas for improvement through their DUPR ratings.\nPrecise Programming. DUPR allows clubs to create programming for specific skill levels and require a DUPR rating to participate, eliminating the issue of matching players with very different skill levels.¬†\nCommunity Engagement. DUPR fosters a vibrant pickleball community by providing a platform for players to connect, compete, and grow together.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR has achieved broad adoption across the pickleball community. The biggest barrier to greater adoption and more games being reported is the friction currently involved in submitting scores. PodPlay‚Äôs DUPR Challenge Match feature eliminates all of that friction.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nEliminating Friction is a Core PodPlay Design Principle\n\nIn Your App is Your Front Door, we wrote about PodPlay‚Äôs obsession with creating the kind of customer experience for end users that is so good they want to tell others about it. An insanely great technology experience is one that allows customers to get what they want with as little work as possible. When it comes to the user experience, less is often more. Some of the areas where PodPlay has made dramatic improvements over legacy systems are:\n\n‚Äç\n\nOnboarding. Customers are able to browse court availability, programming, and more before creating a customer account. We don‚Äôt make customers fill out a long form and give you their payment info before they know what you offer. Create too much friction at onboarding and customers may give up before they even get started.\nQuick Replays. Customers love capturing magic moments and sharing them with their network. They DO NOT love doing any work to get those replays. Make them set up a camera, scan a QR Code, or create a login on a separate system to get their highlights and usage plummets. PodPlay‚Äôs game-changing replay functionality is designed to allow players to capture great moments without taking them out of the flow of their game.¬†\nCoach Connect. Using PodPlay‚Äôs Coach Connect feature, customers are able to discover, coordinate and pay coaches with a couple of clicks. No e-mails, no texts, no need for Venmo after the lesson. By eliminating friction, the feature drives large increases in coaching activity.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nWith DUPR Challenge Matches, we can add reporting scores to DUPR to the list of functions where PodPlay has collapsed a multi-step process into a single step.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Pickleball Tournament of the Future\n\nPodPlay does not yet offer tournament and league management, but these are areas we plan to tackle in 2025. By combining tournament and league management with PodPlay Scoreboards and the DUPR Challenge Match feature, it is not hard to imagine a massive reduction in the need for tournament and league staffing. Stay tuned for future developments!\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe PodPlay Advantage\n\nPodPlay gives venue operators all the tools they need to digitally manage a physical space - integrating video replays, automated scoreboards, and autonomous functionality with a reservation engine, event management, coach connect, membership module, and payments.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nOriginally built to power PingPod, the network of futuristic autonomous ping pong clubs, PodPlay is now being used to manage venues across pickleball, padel, ping pong, golf simulators, racing simulators, soccer and pool, with more experience verticals to come in the future.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIf you‚Äôre interested in learning more, request a demo.\n\n‚Äç"}

The pickleballs appearance is one of the most distinctive aspects of the sport. Let‚Äôs break down the pickleballs design, shape, texture, and other important features to give you a better idea of what makes this ball so unique.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleballs Shape and Size\n\nThe most obvious feature of a pickleball is its shape. It is round, like most balls, but it‚Äôs design sets it apart. Pickleballs typically measure between 2.87 and 2.97 inches in diameter, making them slightly smaller than a tennis ball but still large enough to handle comfortably. The pickleball ball sizes are standardized for most play, whether you're on an indoor or outdoor court.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleballs Material and Texture\n\nWhen you look at a pickleball up close, you'll notice it‚Äôs made of a durable plastic material. Unlike a traditional tennis ball that‚Äôs covered in felt, the pickleballs material is hollow and solid plastic, with holes strategically placed around the surface. This perforation affects its texture, creating a smooth yet slightly dimpled surface. The texture is crucial because it helps the ball glide smoothly through the air and bounce predictably on the court. The holes in the design also reduce the ball‚Äôs bounce compared to other sports balls, creating a more controlled game.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleballs Colors\n\nAs for the pickleballs‚Äô colors, they are often quite bright and vibrant. Most commonly, outdoor pickleballs are yellow, making them easy to see under the sun. However, you can also find pickleballs in other bold colors, such as orange, green, pink or even white. These pickleball colors are designed to enhance visibility, which is essential for fast-paced games.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleballs Features\n\nWhat truly sets the pickleball design apart is its combination of features that make it perfect for the game. Pickleballs features include the hole pattern‚Äîtypically 26-40 holes depending on whether the ball is designed for indoor or outdoor use. The outdoor balls usually have more holes to help reduce wind interference, while indoor balls tend to have fewer holes, resulting in a slightly different flight and bounce.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleball Ball Sizes for Different Environments\n\nThere‚Äôs a subtle difference in pickleball ball sizes depending on the type of court you're playing on. Indoor pickleballs are generally lighter and have fewer holes, making them better suited for the calmer environment of indoor courts. Outdoor pickleballs, on the other hand, are heavier and have more holes to better resist wind. The slight differences in pickleball ball sizes ensure that the game plays fairly no matter the conditions."}

Whether you're a seasoned player or just starting out, choosing the right indoor pickleball can make all the difference in your game. This guide will explore the unique features of indoor pickleballs, the best brands available, and essential equipment, so you can optimize your gameplay.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat Makes Indoor Pickleballs Unique?\n\n‚Äç\n\nIndoor pickleballs are designed specifically for indoor play on smooth courts. Unlike outdoor pickleballs, which are built to withstand wind and rough surfaces, indoor pickleballs are optimized for controlled indoor environments.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWeight and Control: Indoor pickleballs tend to be lighter than their outdoor counterparts, making them easier to control. This lighter weight allows for more precise shots and greater maneuverability. It‚Äôs particularly helpful for players who prefer finesse and control rather than power.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLarger, Fewer Holes: Indoor pickleballs typically feature fewer holes and larger openings. This reduces drag and creates a more predictable flight pattern. Since there‚Äôs no wind indoors to affect the ball‚Äôs movement, the larger holes provide a balanced trajectory.\n\n‚Äç\n\nSofter Bounce and Impact: Indoor pickleballs are crafted to provide a consistent bounce, making them ideal for indoor courts. They also feature a softer impact, which contributes to a smoother playing experience and less noise during matches. This is important in indoor settings, where sound levels can be more noticeable.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBest Indoor Pickleballs on the Market\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhen selecting indoor pickleballs, personal preference and playing style play a significant role. High-quality indoor pickleballs are designed for durability, visibility, and performance. Below are some of the top-rated brands:\n\n‚Äç\n\nONIX Fuse Indoor Pickleballs\n\n\nONIX Fuse balls are known for their durability, true flight, and consistent bounce, making them a favorite among competitive players. Their design ensures that the ball maintains a steady path throughout the game, providing excellent control.\n\n‚Äç\n\nGamma Photon Indoor Pickleballs\n\n‚Äç\n\nThese pickleballs are praised for their visibility and balanced feel, offering precision and consistency. The unique hole pattern and the soft feel make them ideal for players who rely on control.\n\n‚Äç\n\nJugs Indoor Pickleballs\n\n\nJugs balls are lightweight and soft, perfect for recreational play. Their softer construction makes them a great choice for beginners or those who prefer a less aggressive playing style.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhen selecting the best indoor pickleballs for you, consider the material used, bounce consistency, and hole pattern that best aligns with your style of play.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIndoor vs Outdoor Pickleballs: Key Differences\n\n‚Äç\n\nUnderstanding the differences between indoor and outdoor pickleballs can help you adapt your strategy for each environment. Both types are designed with specific needs in mind, so it's essential to recognize how they impact gameplay.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBounce: Indoor pickleballs have a softer bounce compared to outdoor balls. This is ideal for finesse shots, where precision and control are crucial. The softer bounce also makes it easier to perform delicate shots like dinks and drops.\n\n‚Äç\n\nNoise: Indoor pickleballs are quieter than outdoor ones, which is important in indoor environments where noise can be disruptive. This quieter performance makes indoor balls more suited to the acoustics of indoor courts, where sound tends to echo.\n\n‚Äç\n\nVisibility: Indoor pickleballs often come in bright colors, such as neon green or yellow, to improve visibility under artificial lighting. This ensures that players can track the ball more easily during fast-paced rallies, especially in gyms or courts with low lighting.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHole Pattern: Indoor balls generally have fewer, larger holes. This reduces drag and makes the ball fly with greater consistency. In contrast, outdoor pickleballs have more, smaller holes to better withstand wind and other elements outside.\n\n‚Äç\n\nSurface Compatibility: Indoor pickleballs are made for smooth surfaces, allowing for a more predictable bounce. In contrast, outdoor balls are designed to withstand harsher surfaces, such as asphalt or concrete, which makes them more rugged and durable.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIndoor Pickleball Reviews: What Players Are Saying\n\n‚Äç\n\nIndoor pickleball reviews often highlight the importance of selecting the right ball for your playing style. Competitive players typically prefer balls with consistent performance, while recreational players may opt for lighter, softer balls. Reviews also mention that the best indoor pickleballs deliver a dependable bounce and durability over time.\n\n‚Äç\n\nCompetitive Players: Many competitive players favor ONIX and Gamma balls due to their consistent flight and durability. These brands are recognized for their ability to maintain control even in high-intensity games.\n\n‚Äç\n\nRecreational Players: Recreational players often prefer Jugs for their lightweight feel and affordability. These balls are easy to play with and provide a great experience without the high cost.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFeedback from players consistently emphasizes the importance of choosing indoor pickleballs with a good balance of durability, visibility, and consistent bounce.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy Brand Matters in Indoor Pickleballs\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe brand of your indoor pickleball can have a significant impact on your gameplay. Trusted brands invest in quality materials and conduct rigorous testing to ensure their products meet the expectations of players at every skill level. Popular brands like ONIX, Franklin, and Gamma are known for their consistency, durability, and innovation.\n\n‚Äç\n\nONIX: ONIX is a leading brand known for producing durable balls with excellent flight characteristics. Their indoor pickleballs are designed to provide precision and consistency, making them a popular choice for competitive play.\n\n‚Äç\n\nGamma: Gamma pickleballs are known for their balance and precision. They offer excellent visibility and are ideal for players who want a reliable ball for recreational and competitive play.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFranklin Sports: A trusted name in pickleball, Franklin Sports provides high-quality indoor pickleballs that are perfect for casual and competitive players alike. Their commitment to durability and innovation makes them a top choice.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDura: Dura is a great choice for competitive players. Known for their durability and consistent flight, Dura balls are designed to withstand intense gameplay and provide reliable performance.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleball Now: Pickleball Now balls are designed with recreational players in mind. They provide an affordable option for casual games without sacrificing playability.\n\n‚Äç\n\nSpecifications to Look For in Indoor Pickleballs\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhen choosing indoor pickleballs, understanding their specifications can help you make an informed decision. Indoor pickleballs are typically about 2.87 inches in diameter and weigh between 0.8 and 0.9 ounces. These measurements provide an optimal balance of control and durability for indoor courts.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHole Pattern: Indoor balls generally have larger, fewer holes, which helps reduce drag and makes the ball fly more smoothly. This design is ideal for indoor conditions where wind isn‚Äôt a factor.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBounce Quality: The bounce of an indoor pickleball is softer than that of an outdoor ball, which is crucial for indoor play. The softer bounce ensures that the ball reacts predictably on smooth surfaces, making it easier to control during play.\n\n‚Äç\n\nMaterial: Polyethylene is the most common material for indoor pickleballs. It offers a good balance of durability, softness, and consistent bounce, making it the preferred choice for most indoor balls.\n\n‚Äç\n\nKey Differences Between Indoor Pickleballs\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhile all indoor pickleballs are designed for smooth courts, they are not all the same. Some are made for competitive play, offering precision and durability, while others are better suited for casual games due to their softer feel and affordability.\n\n‚Äç\n\nMaterial: Polyethylene is widely used in indoor balls for its balance of softness and durability. It ensures a consistent bounce while maintaining the ball's structural integrity.\n\n‚Äç\n\nVisibility: Bright colors like neon green or yellow improve visibility, ensuring players can track the ball easily in indoor settings, even under artificial lighting.\n\n‚Äç\n\nControl: Indoor pickleballs are designed to provide better control and spin, thanks to their smooth surfaces and predictable bounce. This allows for a more strategic game focused on placement and precision.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIndoor Pickleball Buying Guide\n\n‚Äç\n\nPurchasing indoor pickleballs doesn't have to be overwhelming. Here are a few steps to help you choose the right ball for your needs:\n\n‚Äç\n\n1. Assess Your Needs: Determine whether you play recreationally or competitively. Competitive players may prioritize durability and consistent performance, while recreational players might look for affordability and a lightweight design.\n\n‚Äç\n\n2. Research Brands: Stick to trusted names in the pickleball industry. ONIX, Gamma, and Jugs are all well-regarded brands known for producing high-quality indoor pickleballs.\n\n‚Äç\n\n3. Read Reviews: Check player reviews to get an idea of how the ball performs in real-world conditions. This can give you valuable insights into bounce quality, durability, and overall playability.\n\n‚Äç\n\n4. Test Different Balls: Try out different balls from various brands to see which one feels best for your style of play. You may find that one ball‚Äôs bounce or weight suits your game better than another.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFeatures That Make Great Indoor Pickleballs\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe best indoor pickleballs deliver consistent bounce, durability, and excellent visibility. High-quality indoor balls also feature smooth surfaces for better control and spin, and their durability minimizes the need for frequent replacements. Bright colors help players keep track of the ball during fast exchanges, while lightweight designs enhance maneuverability.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow DUPR Enhances Indoor Pickleball Matches\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor serious players, DUPR (Dynamic Universal Pickleball Rating) offers a tool to track performance and find opponents of similar skill levels.

Start your pickleball journey with a coach-assigned rating and confidently join tournaments and leagues.", "url": "https://www.dupr.com/post/ben-collin-johns-team-stats", "content": "The professional pickleball world was recently met with the news that Ben and Collin Johns, one of the sport's most dominant partnerships in this era of of the sport, will be parting ways heading into 2025. As this chapter closes on one of pickleball's most successful teams, we want to take a look at the remarkable statistics that defined their partnership and explore how they have helped shape the game.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBy the Numbers\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe statistics behind the Johns brothers' partnership tell a story of unprecedented dominance. From 2020 through 2023, they maintained win percentages that redefined excellence in professional pickleball. Their peak came in 2023 with an extraordinary 93.51% win rate, securing 72 victories against just 5 losses. This followed equally impressive showings in 2020/2021 (91.38%) and 2022 (90.11%).\n\n‚Äç\n\nWith an 81.71% win rate in 2024 (67 wins, 15 losses), the Johns brothers showed signs of change while maintaining a level of success most partnerships dream of. Their consistency across seasons set competitive standards in professional pickleball. Meanwhile, competition is tougher than ever. Ben remains number 1, but Collin, once ranked in the mid-teens for male doubles, has dropped to 33rd over the last year. The sport has evolved around them with new talent raising the bar.\n\n‚Äç\n\nMedal Count and Tournament Dominance\n\n‚Äç\n\nTheir tournament achievements paint an even more compelling picture. Across 66 tournaments, they accumulated 52 medals - 43 golds, 8 silvers, and 1 bronze. This translates to a remarkable 79% podium percentage and a 65% rate of securing gold medals. Their year-by-year consistency tells its own story:\n\n‚Äç\n\n2024/2025: 8 gold medals (tour-leading), 2 silvers\n2023: 13 gold medals, 1 silver - their most dominant year\n2022: 13 gold medals, 4 silvers - establishing their dynasty\n2021/2020: 9 gold medals, 1 silver, 1 bronze (in just 12 tournaments)\n\n‚Äç\n\nTo put these numbers in perspective, Ben Johns has accumulated 43 career gold medals in men's doubles, while Collin has 33. The next closest competitor, Matt Wright, stands at 18. As a team, their 33 gold medals significantly outpace other partnerships - Frazier/Johnson and Newman/Wright follow with 10 and 8 golds respectively (Pickleball.com).\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe 2024 Transition Year\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe 2024 season marked a notable shift in their dominance, coinciding with broader changes in professional pickleball. The sport's evolution toward a more power-driven style presented new challenges to their traditionally patient, strategic approach. Their 81.71% win rate, while still impressive, represented the first time in four years they performed below the 90% threshold.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis transition reflected larger changes in professional pickleball, where the emphasis shifted from the dinking game to a more aggressive, power-based style. The introduction of new equipment and evolving tactics meant that the patient, methodical approach that had served them so well faced new challenges.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Johns brothers' adaptation to these changes, while successful by most standards, couldn't quite match their previous levels of dominance.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTournament-by-Tournament Analysis\n\n‚Äç\n\nA closer look at their tournament performances reveals remarkable consistency. In their 58 tournaments together, they reached at least the semifinals in 51 events - an 88% rate of deep tournament runs. This level of consistency is particularly impressive given the increasing depth of talent in professional pickleball and the physical demands of the modern game.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTheir ability to perform under pressure was equally notable. In gold medal matches, they maintained a winning percentage above 80%, demonstrating their capacity to elevate their game when the stakes were highest. This clutch performance helped establish their reputation as the team to beat in any major tournament.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIndividual Achievements and Partnership Synergy\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhile both players brought individual strengths to the partnership, their success stemmed from exceptional teamwork and complementary skills. Ben's aggressive style and dynamic shot-making paired perfectly with Collin's steady defensive play and consistent resetting ability. This combination created a partnership that could adapt to any opponent's strategy while maintaining their own high level of play.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTheir individual achievements within the partnership are equally impressive. Ben's 43 career gold medals in men's doubles set a standard that may never be matched, while Collin's 33 gold medals would be a career-defining achievement for most players, highlighting the extraordinary nature of their partnership.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLooking Ahead to 2025\n\n‚Äç\n\nAs both players look toward 2025, the professional pickleball landscape enters a new era. Ben Johns, widely regarded as one of the sport's premier players, has several potential high-profile partnerships on the horizon. For Collin, who has demonstrated particular strength on the right side, opportunities exist to forge new partnerships that could showcase different aspects of his game.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe dissolution of this partnership will lead to changes across professional pickleball as players adjust their strategies for the 2025 season. The season is expected to be one of the most dynamic in recent memory, with new partnerships and rivalries forming.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIt has been rumored that Ben will team up with Gabe Tardio, Hayden Patriquin, and Maxwell Freeman, a left-handed player, along with potentially others not mentioned. The combination of an aggressive right-handed player with a lefty-righty duo will be closely watched, as Ben has previously stated that this type of pairing could be the future of the game‚Äôs top partnerships.\n\n‚Äç\n\nOverall, the Johns brothers' partnership represents more than just statistical excellence - it established a benchmark that may stand unchallenged in professional pickleball. Their consistent performance over multiple years, maintaining extraordinary win percentages and accumulating medals at an unprecedented rate, speaks to a level of dominance rarely seen in any sport.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTheir legacy extends beyond their on-court achievements. They helped establish professional pickleball's competitive standards, influenced training methodologies, and contributed to the sport's growing popularity. While their partnership may be ending, their impact on the sport will continue to be felt for years to come.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAttribution: Data and background information sourced from DUPR and Pickleball.com\n\n‚Äç"}

{"title": "Enhancing Accuracy: Exciting Updates to Your DUPR Rating", "date": "January 14, 2025", "summary": "Explore the latest DUPR rating updates, including dynamic ratings and rally scoring improvements, to better reflect your pickleball performance.", "url": "https://www.dupr.com/post/mastering-your-serve-exploring-common-service-stances-in-pickleball", "content": "Your service stance in pickleball can significantly influence your game. Whether you're aiming for power, spin, or balance, understanding the pros and cons of different stances can elevate your serve. Pro player Bobbi Oshiro breaks down the common service stances and their unique advantages.\n\n‚Äç\n\n1. The Open Stance\n\nThe open stance is characterized by feet and hips aligned slightly parallel to the baseline. Tyson McGuffin, a top pro player, is a prime example of this stance in action.\n\nAdvantages: This stance helps generate more topspin, often resulting in a serve with a noticeable arch. By loading the dominant leg and efficiently rotating the hips, players can get underneath the ball to add that extra spin.\nIdeal For: Players who want to add a curve to their serve and aim to challenge opponents with unpredictable ball movement.\n2. The Closed Stance\n\nIn the closed stance, feet and hips are positioned slightly perpendicular to the baseline. Dekel Bar, known for his powerful serves, often uses this stance.\n\nAdvantages: This position typically produces a flatter and faster serve. The perpendicular alignment allows for a more direct and forceful ball trajectory.\nIdeal For: Players looking to dominate with speed and power, keeping opponents on the defensive.\n3. The Semi-Open Stance\n\nThe semi-open stance is a hybrid of the open and closed stances. According to Bobbi Oshiro, this stance offers a balanced approach.\n\nAdvantages: It provides versatility, enabling players to switch between generating topspin and delivering a flatter serve when needed.\nIdeal For: Players seeking a middle ground between power and spin, offering adaptability to different match situations.\nFinding Your Perfect Serve Stance\n\nEach stance has its unique strengths, so the key is experimenting to discover what suits your playing style. Whether you‚Äôre aiming to outspin, outpace, or outmaneuver your opponent, your service stance can be a game-changer. Take inspiration from the pros, hit the court, and start fine-tuning your serve today!"}

The Air Force veteran recently made waves on social media when he posted a video of himself playing pickleball in Antarctica, trading the usual court surface for packed snow and ice. While the conditions weren't exactly regulation ‚Äì there wasn't even a net ‚Äì the video captured the imagination of pickleball enthusiasts worldwide and highlighted just how far the sport has spread.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor Wood, who is stationed near Tacoma, Washington, the journey to becoming a pickleball ambassador in one of Earth's most remote locations began with a simple Father's Day gift in 2024. His daughters gave him a starter pickleball set from Target, and what started as a casual introduction to the sport quickly developed into a passionate pursuit. With a background in tennis, Wood found himself naturally drawn to the game's familiar yet distinct mechanics.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFrom Military Aviation to Antarctic Pickleball\n\n‚Äç\n\nAs Director of Operations for the Air Force's Antarctica mission supporting the National Science Foundation, Wood's path to playing pickleball at McMurdo Station was anything but typical. His role involves coordinating C-17 flights from Christchurch, New Zealand, to Antarctica, and transporting scientists, support personnel, and essential equipment to the research station. The mission represents a crucial partnership between military aviation and scientific research, ensuring that vital studies can continue in one of the world's most challenging environments.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Antarctic video wasn't exactly a planned exhibition match. Wood and a fellow service member ventured onto the parking apron, where the surface was relatively flat and compact. Despite temperatures hovering around five degrees Fahrenheit and the absence of a net, they managed to rally back and forth, though Wood admits with a laugh that there wasn't much dinking involved ‚Äì mostly lobs.\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"Next time I think we probably need to put up a net,\" Wood said. \"You know, that would make it a little more legit.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe extreme conditions required careful preparation, with players donning multiple layers of specialized cold-weather gear. Wood explained that in Antarctica, even your eyes need protection.\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"You've got to make sure that you have goggles on, because your eyes literally will freeze open because it's so cold,‚Äù he stressed.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFinding a Pickleball Community Abroad\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhile his Antarctic pickleball adventure gained attention, Wood's regular pickleball routine actually blossomed during his time in New Zealand. The owner of their hotel in Christchurch, upon learning about the team's enthusiasm for pickleball, converted his tennis court into two pickleball courts. This thoughtful adaptation allowed Wood and his fellow service members to play almost daily during their stays.\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"We played almost every day,\" Wood recalled. \"And then in Christchurch, there's a local pickleball group where they have indoor sessions, and when the weather turns nice, they go outdoors. It's an up-and-coming pickleball locale in New Zealand.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nStrengthening Military Bonds Through Pickleball\n\n‚Äç\n\nAs both an active Air Force Reserve pilot and a veteran of 10 years of active duty service, Wood sees tremendous potential for pickleball to bring together service members and veterans. The sport's accessibility and social nature make it an ideal platform for building connections within the military community.\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"Anytime that you have people that have served, veterans... one thing they like to do is, especially when you're waiting for a game, they just love to talk about their time,\" Wood explained. \"If they know that you're a veteran, they love to share their stories and their experiences and just kind of talk about their service.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nWood believes a veterans-based pickleball league would be highly successful, citing the unspoken camaraderie that naturally emerges when veterans connect and share their experiences.\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"It would be a great way for veterans to kind of bond and to lead not only into pickleball, but then also talk about life. Any issues that veterans have, they can find someone to have an ally in,‚Äù Wood shared.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor active duty service members considering picking up a paddle, Wood emphasizes the natural fit between military values and pickleball culture.\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"Being a service member, staying fit, being competitive, right? Those are important things,\" he notes. \"And for those of us that maybe don't have the chops to play tennis anymore like we used to, pickleball is a nice way to downshift.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nBringing Pickleball to Military Bases and Beyond\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhen he's not flying C-17s or playing pickleball in extreme conditions, Wood keeps busy with various pursuits. He works as a simulator instructor for Air Force pilots and runs a youth basketball league with 150 teams in the East Seattle metro area. A native of Central Washington, he embraces the outdoor lifestyle of the Pacific Northwest, enjoying activities like skiing, camping, and mountain biking.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLooking ahead, Wood envisions pickleball continuing to grow within military communities, both on and off base. He sees potential for partnerships between pickleball organizations like DUPR and Military Welfare and Recreation (MWR) programs to help facilitate this growth, suggesting that existing tennis court infrastructure could be converted to support the rising interest in pickleball among service members.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFrom the frozen expanse of Antarctica to the courts of New Zealand and back home in Washington state, Wood's pickleball journey exemplifies the sport's ability to create connections and community in unexpected places. His story reminds us that whether you're playing on a professional court or the Antarctic ice, pickleball's true value lies in its power to bring people together ‚Äì even at the bottom of the world.\n\n‚Äç"}

Learn how our rating system, Reliability Score, and events help you improve and connect.", "url": "https://www.dupr.com/post/who-invented-pickleball-a-complete-history-and-origins-of-the-sport", "content": "Pickleball, America's fastest-growing sport, began as a simple backyard game created to entertain children. Today, it has evolved into a beloved game for people of all ages. Its quirky name, easy-to-learn rules, and inclusive nature have helped pickleball gain massive popularity worldwide. But who invented pickleball, and why did it become so popular?\n\nThe Birth of Pickleball: Who Invented It and Why?\n\nPickleball‚Äôs origins trace back to the summer of 1965 on Bainbridge Island, Washington. Three dads‚ÄîJoel Pritchard, a congressman; Bill Bell, a businessman; and Barney McCallum‚Äîcreated the game to entertain their families. The Pritchard family returned from a golf outing to find their children bored and looking for something fun to do. These fathers quickly came together to create a new game, one that would be enjoyable for everyone, regardless of skill level.\n\n‚Äç\n\nOver several weekends, the dads tested different rules and equipment. Their families became their test subjects, helping shape the early development of pickleball. The inventors‚Äô commitment to making the game accessible for all players laid the foundation for pickleball‚Äôs future success.\n\nPickleball Invention Facts: When Was Pickleball Invented?\n\nThe pickleball invention date is clearly documented, marking its inception in 1965. The inventors used an old badminton court, ping-pong paddles, and a perforated plastic ball to create the initial setup. The rules of pickleball combined elements from badminton, tennis, and table tennis, creating a unique game with simple, accessible rules.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAs neighbors became interested, the game‚Äôs popularity spread quickly throughout the Bainbridge Island community. The accessibility and social aspects of pickleball contributed to its rapid growth and laid the groundwork for its future success.\n\nWhy Is It Called Pickleball? The Name‚Äôs Origins\n\nThe question \"Why is it called pickleball?\" has two main theories. One popular explanation is that Joan Pritchard, Joel‚Äôs wife, named the game after \"pickle boats\" in crew racing. These boats are often crewed by rowers from different teams, much like how pickleball combines elements of various sports. The name \"pickleball\" perfectly represents the sport's inclusive nature, welcoming players from all skill levels and backgrounds.\n\nThe Evolution of Pickleball: Milestones and Growth\n\nFrom its humble beginnings to global recognition, pickleball has grown significantly. Key milestones in pickleball‚Äôs history include:\n\n1967: First permanent pickleball court built.\n1972: Official corporation formed to protect the sport.\n1990: Pickleball becomes popular across all 50 states.\n2022: Pickleball is named the official state sport of Washington.\n\nIn the 1970s, tournament play began, and by the 1980s, pickleball was a staple in community centers and retirement communities. Its widespread appeal contributed to its continued growth.\n\nPickleball Equipment: Early Developments and Innovations\n\nThe evolution of pickleball equipment showcases the creativity and problem-solving involved in the game‚Äôs development. Initially, the inventors used hand-carved wooden paddles, which were heavier than today‚Äôs designs. The first pickleball balls were repurposed wiffle balls, chosen for their perfect combination of bounce and air resistance.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAs pickleball gained popularity, specialized paddles and balls were created, improving play quality and making the game more standardized. These innovations helped ensure the sport‚Äôs continued growth and appeal.\n\nPickleball‚Äôs Impact on Communities and Health\n\nOne of the most significant aspects of pickleball's growth is its ability to bring communities together. Initially played in community centers and retirement homes, pickleball has been praised for its social nature and the bonds it creates. The sport is particularly popular with older adults, who benefit from its low-impact nature, while also attracting younger generations to the game.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleball‚Äôs appeal lies in its ability to engage people of all ages, providing a fun and active way to connect socially. It has become a staple of community wellness programs, praised for its ability to keep players physically active, mentally sharp, and socially connected.\n\nModern Pickleball: Rules and Competitive Growth\n\nToday's pickleball rules have evolved while staying true to the sport‚Äôs core values of accessibility and fun. Played on a court similar to a badminton court, the game uses specially designed paddles and a perforated ball. The game combines social play with competitive elements, making it suitable for recreational players and serious athletes alike.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleball‚Äôs growth in recent years is nothing short of extraordinary. In 2023, the Sports & Fitness Industry Association reported that pickleball had more than 8.9 million players in the U.S., making it the fastest-growing sport in the country for the third consecutive year.\n\nThe Legacy of the Pickleball Inventors\n\nThe story of pickleball is a celebration of American ingenuity and community spirit. What began as a backyard game created by three dads has grown into a global phenomenon. Joel Pritchard‚Äôs legacy extends beyond pickleball. He also served as a Washington State representative and lieutenant governor, contributing to the development of the state and its communities.\n\n‚Äç\n\nToday, pickleball continues to grow in popularity while remaining true to the values set by its inventors: inclusivity, fun, and community engagement. The inventors may not have become wealthy from their creation, but they gave the world a sport that unites people across generations and promotes healthy, active living.\n\n‚Äç\n\nImage credit: jpritchard.com"}

From his early days as a competitive tennis player to his rise as a top 10 senior pickleball player, Scott has embraced every twist and turn in his athletic journey. Let‚Äôs dive into what inspired Scott to start playing pickleball, what motivates him, and his advice for aspiring players.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDiscovering Pickleball: From Tennis Pro to Pickler\n\n‚Äç\n\nScott‚Äôs athletic journey began at just 8 years old when he started playing competitive tennis. His talent led him to a successful D1 college career and a stint in the professional tennis world, but by his mid-20s, he decided to hang up his racket. Moving to Boulder, CO, Scott immersed himself in endurance sports, competing in triathlons and enjoying mountain sports like snowboarding. Then, in 2019, everything changed. A friend suggested he try pickleball, and though he initially dismissed it as a casual backyard game, Scott quickly realized its potential.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúAt first, I thought pickleball was just some backyard BBQ game, like cornhole,‚Äù he admits. ‚ÄúBut within a week, I‚Äôd sold two bikes, dropped out of all my upcoming races, and set off on becoming a pickler!‚Äù\nScott fondly calls pickleball his ‚ÄúBack to the Future sport,‚Äù saying, ‚ÄúIt feels like it was custom-designed for me, blending my tennis background, endurance sports, and even the silly after-school games I used to play as a kid.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nNow in his late 50s, Scott is thriving in the sport, competing at the highest levels and feeling grateful for every moment on the court.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat Keeps Scott Motivated\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor Scott, pickleball offers more than just athletic competition. The camaraderie, especially in doubles play, is what he treasures most. While he enjoys the physical grind of singles, doubles is, in his opinion, ‚Äúthe essence of pickleball.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúI really dig the camaraderie that exists in the game,‚Äù Scott shares. ‚ÄúIn doubles, it‚Äôs not just about athleticism; it‚Äôs about trust, teamwork, and strategy. That‚Äôs what makes it so special.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nOver the past two years, Scott has competed in the National Pickleball League (NPL), a team-based league for players aged 50 and over. As the captain of the Denver Iconics, Scott thrived on the intense competition, team spirit, and mentoring opportunities.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúI loved the amazing competition against the best senior pro players in the game,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut the coaching, mentoring, and team bonding throughout the season made it an unforgettable experience.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nTracking Progress with DUPR\n\n‚Äç\n\nAs a competitor, Scott values measurable progress, and DUPR has become an essential tool. Reflecting on his junior tennis days, Scott recalls waiting weeks to see ranking updates. In contrast, DUPR provides real-time data, allowing him to track his performance and progress.\n\n‚ÄúI love how DUPR gives feedback within days‚Äîor even sooner,‚Äù Scott says. ‚ÄúAfter a strong outing, I get excited to check the DUPR app and geek out on my matches to see how they‚Äôve impacted my rating. Then I cross my fingers, hoping I‚Äôve moved up a spot or two on the rankings page!‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\nOver the past year, we‚Äôve seen incredible progress from senior pro player Scott, proving that improvement has no age limit! His DUPR rating increased by 0.3 in doubles (from 5.578 to 5.874) and 0.2 in singles (from 5.422 to 5.675), while his average opponent rating also climbed as he consistently sought out higher-level competition. By challenging himself with tougher matchups, Scott not only elevated his game but demonstrated that you can keep improving‚Äîno matter your age. It‚Äôs inspiring to see players 50+ continue to thrive, push boundaries, and grow through DUPR. In addition, his games and points won % went up - meaning he continued to win against tougher competition.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor Scott, DUPR isn‚Äôt just a rating system‚Äîit adds a fun, gamified element to his competitive journey.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a game within the game,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt keeps me motivated between tournaments.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nFuture Goals and Growing the Game\n\n‚Äç\n\nScott and his wife, Kari, are not just players but also ambassadors for the sport. They own a 5-court indoor pickleball facility in Boulder, CO, where they foster a thriving community of players. Through DUPR programs and events, their members focus on improving their skills and ratings.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúMy goal is to continue representing our community at the top of the pro game while sharing everything I can with players of all levels,‚Äù Scott explains. ‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs through our club or online platforms, I want to help others experience the joy and growth this game offers.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nAdvice for Aspiring Pickleball Players\n\n‚Äç\n\nScott‚Äôs advice for newcomers is simple but invaluable: find your community and seek proper guidance.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúWhen I started, I was lucky to have seasoned players who adopted me and didn‚Äôt let me fall into bad habits from my tennis background,‚Äù he recalls. His recommendation? ‚ÄúJoin open play sessions, seek out proper instruction through clinics, and take private lessons.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nOne of Scott‚Äôs favorite learning formats is the ‚Äú3-and-me‚Äù session, which includes three players and a teaching pro.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúYou get a lot of play, and the coach can see and critique you during live action. These sessions are super fun and highly productive,‚Äù he shares.\n\n‚Äç\n\nScott Fliegelman‚Äôs journey from competitive tennis to senior pickleball is a testament to his love of sport, community, and growth. Whether competing at the highest levels, mentoring players, or fostering his local pickleball community, Scott is making a lasting impact on the game.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAs Scott puts it, ‚ÄúPickleball has been the perfect sport for me. It‚Äôs given me the chance to compete, connect, and grow‚Äîboth as a player and as a person.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nFollow Scott‚Äôs journey on Instagram or visit his Boulder facility to learn from one of the sport‚Äôs most passionate ambassadors.

In addition, strength training develops resilient muscles, bones, tendons, and ligaments, which is critical for longevity in the sport.\n\nConsistently engaging in structured warmups, cooldowns, and bi-weekly resistance training will create a solid foundation for long-term physical resilience.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nNow, let's examine what advanced players need to focus on.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAdvanced (4.000 - 4.999): Mental Game and Recovery\n\n‚Äç\n\nAdvanced players must integrate basic psychological skills with systematic fueling and recovery protocols.\n\nThis dual focus will determine performance consistency in high-stakes competitive environments.\n\nImplement research-backed mental preparation techniques (breathwork, visualization, mindfulness)\nDevelop comprehensive match-day nutrition and hydration strategies\nCreate structured recovery routines that enhance sleep quality and tissue repair\n\nAt this level, technical mastery alone won't secure victory. The psychological battleground becomes paramount, where strategic decisions under pressure define match outcomes. Your ability to maintain mental clarity while managing physical resources becomes the critical performance differentiator.\n\nThe advanced player's success framework integrates three core domains:\n\nMental Performance Architecture:\n\nSelf Regulation: Mastering pre-point breathing patterns and emotional control\nAttentional Focus: Developing robust visualization and mindfulness practices\nDecision-Making Under Press: Building systematic decision-making frameworks for crucial moments\n\nFueling & Recovery Fundamentals:\n\nHydration Protocols: Personalized pre/during/post-match fluid strategies\nNutritional Timing: Strategic fueling for matches and tournament progression\nSleep: Evidence-based routines for restful and fulfilling sleep\n\nPlayers who invest in this integrated approach will experience more consistent performance.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe professional level demands even more sophisticated performance optimization strategies.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPro (5.000 - 8.000): High-Performance Systems\n\n‚Äç\n\nProfessional players must manage multiple performance variables simultaneously.\n\nSuccess requires systematic monitoring and adjustment of all training elements.\n\nTrack subjective and objective performance metrics daily (e.g., HRV, training load,¬† subjective wellness, etc.)\nWork with qualified specialists (e.g., nutrition, mental game, strength, etc.)\nImplement science-backed recovery tools and protocols.\n\nTop professionals work with a high performance team to improve the physical, psychological, technical, and tactical elements of the game.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Path Forward\n\n‚Äç\n\nYour pickleball journey requires a different focus at each stage.

Find your best fit.", "url": "https://www.dupr.com/post/how-st-louis-shock-uses-dupr-to-grow-their-community", "content": "At the forefront of pickleball‚Äôs rising popularity in St. Louis, the St. Louis Shock is tapping into the power of DUPR to not only grow their brand but also foster a loyal community of pickleball enthusiasts. The Shock is one of the teams in Major League Pickleball (MLP) dedicated to engaging local players and fans while building a dynamic community around the sport. According to Andrew Haines, Chief Operating Officer of the Shock, these events are pivotal in the team‚Äôs strategy.\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"We‚Äôre really trying to build our brand both locally and nationally,\" Haines said. \"Anything we can do to engage players, whether at an amateur or advanced level, funnels into our long-term plans.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR events are one of the primary vehicles for building that local fan base, attracting players who want to get rated and improve their game. The events are structured around maximizing playing time, keeping the energy high and the downtime low. The Shock has tried various formats to optimize each session.\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"On Friday, we changed it up to two sessions so players could get almost non-stop playtime,\" Haines explained. \"Our goal is to do these weekly and create a community of Shock followers who feel like they're part of the family and team.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy DUPR?\n\nFor teams like the St. Louis Shock, DUPR is more than just a rating system‚Äîit‚Äôs a marketing tool that brings people together and boosts brand recognition. Ryan Maher, Vice President of Partnerships & Programs at DUPR and local to St Louis, noted these events' power:\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"These rating sessions are incredible. For a professional team to be promoting DUPR as their partner is all we could ask for,\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nMaher said, emphasizing how these sessions benefit both organizations. As more players get rated, DUPR grows its user base, while the Shock builds brand loyalty and draws more local fans into the fold. The events are not only attracting players‚Äîthey‚Äôre selling out quickly. For instance, the first two events filled up in less than 24 hours. As Haines described,\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"We charge a small fee that covers registration and a Shock item, like a shirt or hat, and it‚Äôs been incredibly popular. We even had people asking about future events before we‚Äôd wrapped up the current one.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Future Vision for St. Louis Shock\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe St. Louis Shock has ambitious plans, not just locally but nationally. Haines and his team are working on establishing their own venue, aiming to host pickleball events year-round and to become the community hub for pickleball in St. Louis.\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"We hope to open our own facility soon, we want it to be the go-to spot for pickleball in St. Louis,\" Haines said. ‚ÄúAnd this will coincide with some larger goals as well, we want to do everything possible to host MLP at Chaifetz, a 10,000-seat state-of-the-art venue at Saint Louis University‚Äù. Maher was enthusiastic about the venue‚Äôs potential, adding, \"There will not be an MLP event that rivals this. Central Park was amazing, but this arena will be unbelievable.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe team is also exploring ways to involve its players more directly with the community. However, with team members spread across the country, flying everyone in is both time-consuming and costly.\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"All the teams are in the same boat,‚Äù said Haines. \"But by the time we bring players in, we want to make sure it‚Äôs a huge event that really leverages the local fan base we‚Äôve built through these DUPR sessions.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nCultivating Connections and Expanding Nationally\n\n‚Äç\n\nAs the Shock deepens its local presence, it‚Äôs also looking to set the standard in the MLP. By sharing its success with other teams, Haines hopes the Shock can inspire similar community engagement efforts across the league.\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"I‚Äôm getting a lot of calls from other teams wanting to set up their own DUPR events,\" Haines said. \"We share ideas on what we‚Äôre doing in the community, and I‚Äôm a big proponent of these DUPR sessions. It‚Äôs a no-brainer for all the teams.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe collaboration between St. Louis Shock and DUPR is setting a model for what‚Äôs possible when professional sports teams work directly with the communities they represent. The St Louis Shock is the first MLP team to have an Official Club on DUPR. The Shock‚Äôs dedication to building this community isn‚Äôt just about expanding its brand‚Äîit‚Äôs about elevating pickleball as a sport, engaging new players, and creating fans who feel a personal connection to the team.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWith DUPR sessions selling out and pickleball fever spreading in St. Louis, the Shock is well on its way to becoming the heartbeat of the city‚Äôs pickleball scene. As Haines put it:\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"Our goal is to build a community of Shock followers, and this is just the beginning of something bigger for St. Louis.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nCheck out the St Louis Shock schedule for the upcoming season, and find out more on how to set up your DUPR¬†rating session here!"}

Both offer exciting gameplay, but they have distinct characteristics that make each unique. If you‚Äôre curious about pickleball vs. tennis and wondering how they differ, you‚Äôre in the right place! Let‚Äôs explore the key differences and answer the question: Is pickleball easier than tennis?\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow Is Pickleball Different from Tennis?\n\nUnderstanding the differences between pickleball and tennis can enhance your appreciation for each sport. From the dimensions of the court to the nature of the equipment used, these elements shape the gameplay and experience.\n\nCourt Size\nPickleball courts are smaller‚Äî20 feet wide and 44 feet long‚Äîcompared to tennis courts, which are 36 feet wide and 78 feet long. This smaller size makes pickleball more accessible for players of all ages and skill levels, as it requires less physical endurance and allows for quicker reactions.\nEquipment\nIn pickleball, players use a solid paddle and a plastic ball with holes, while tennis players use a strung racquet and a felt-covered ball. The equipment changes how each game feels and plays. The design of pickleball paddles, which can vary in weight and material, influences gameplay, allowing for different styles of play. The lighter, perforated ball used in pickleball travels more slowly, which can create longer rallies and more strategic exchanges.\nScoring\nPickleball has a simpler scoring system. Points can only be scored by the serving team, and games are usually played to 11, 15, or 21 points, with a win by at least 2 points. In contrast, tennis has a more complex system involving games, sets, and tiebreakers, making matches longer and sometimes more strategic.\nServe Style\nPickleball serves are underhand and require the ball to clear the non-volley zone (the kitchen), which encourages a more strategic approach to gameplay. Tennis serves are typically powerful and overhand, allowing for a wider variety of serve types, including spin and speed variations. This difference significantly impacts the pace and rhythm of each game.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIs Pickleball Easier Than Tennis?\n\nWhile the question of whether pickleball is easier than tennis depends on personal preference, here are a few reasons why some find pickleball more beginner-friendly:\n\nLess Running: The smaller court size means players cover less ground, making it easier on the legs and reducing the risk of injury, especially for older players.\nSimple Rules: With straightforward scoring and serving, newcomers can pick it up quickly, making it less intimidating for beginners.\nSocial Vibe: Pickleball is often played in doubles, creating a fun and friendly atmosphere that encourages interaction and teamwork. This can make it more inviting for those new to racquet sports.\n\n‚Äç\n\nOverall, when comparing pickleball vs. tennis, both sports offer excellent ways to stay active and have fun. Whether you‚Äôre drawn to the strategic rallies of tennis or the friendly vibe of pickleball, there‚Äôs something for everyone. Why not give pickleball a shot? You might just discover your new favorite game!"}

Plus, see how choosing the right net can enhance your game and improve your pickleball rating!", "url": "https://www.dupr.com/post/mastering-pickleball-training-techniques-and-tips-for-improvement", "content": "Pickleball, a dynamic and engaging sport, has rapidly gained popularity among players of all ages. Whether you‚Äôre a novice eager to learn or an experienced player looking to refine your skills, focusing on training techniques and understanding the fundamentals of the game is essential. In this blog post, we‚Äôll explore key areas of pickleball training, including grip, shots, spin, and strategies to improve your overall game.\n\n‚Äç\n\nUnderstanding the Pickleball Grip\n\nOne of the first steps to enhancing your pickleball game is mastering the pickleball grip. The grip you choose can significantly impact your control and the power of your shots. Here are three popular grips to consider:\n\nEastern Grip: Similar to the grip used in tennis, the eastern grip allows for versatile shot-making and a good balance of power and control.\nContinental Grip: This grip is favored for its adaptability, making it ideal for various shots, including serves and volleys. It‚Äôs particularly effective for players who like to mix their spins and angles.\nWestern Grip: Primarily used for topspin shots, the western grip can be useful if you want to put more spin on your ball, especially during rallies.\n\nExperiment with different grips to see which one feels most comfortable and effective for you. A proper grip not only improves your shot accuracy but also reduces the risk of injury.\n\n‚Äç\n\nEssential Pickleball Shots\n\nTo get better at pickleball, it‚Äôs crucial to master a range of pickleball shots. Here are the foundational shots every player should practice:\n\nForehand and Backhand Drives: These shots are your primary offensive tools. Focus on footwork and body positioning to ensure powerful and accurate strikes.\nDinks: A gentle shot that lands just over the net, dinks are essential for controlling the pace of the game and forcing your opponent to make a mistake.\nVolleys: Mastering volleys allows you to take advantage of opportunities at the net. Focus on quick reactions and maintaining your paddle position.\nServes: Your serve sets the tone for each rally. A strong and varied serve can keep opponents on their toes.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Art of Pickleball Spin\n\nIncorporating pickleball spin into your shots can give you a competitive edge. Here are a few techniques to develop spin in your game:\n\nTopspin: Achieved by brushing up on the ball, topspin allows for a higher net clearance and a sharper descent. It can be especially effective for both serves and groundstrokes.\nBackspin: When you brush down on the ball, backspin causes it to stay low after bouncing, making it difficult for opponents to return.\nSide Spin: This spin is created by hitting the ball on its side, causing it to curve in the air. It can be a surprise tactic during serves or rallies.\n\nExperimenting with different spins during your practice sessions will help you discover how to best utilize them in matches.\n\n‚Äç\n\nImproving Your Pickleball Backhand\n\nMany players struggle with their backhand. Here are some tips to enhance your backhand game:\n\nStance: Ensure your feet are shoulder-width apart, and your knees are slightly bent to maintain balance.\nGrip: Use either the eastern or continental grip for more control and power in your backhand shots.\nFollow Through: A proper follow-through is essential. Ensure your paddle moves through the ball and finishes high to generate power.\nPractice: Set aside dedicated practice time for your backhand. Repetitive drills will help you gain confidence and consistency.\n\n‚Äç\n\nElevating Your Pickleball Serve\n\nYour pickleball serve is your first opportunity to dictate the point. Here‚Äôs how to improve it:\n\nPractice Different Types of Serves: Work on your underhand, topspin, and slice serves. Varying your serves can make you less predictable to your opponents.\nFocus on Accuracy: Aim for specific areas of the service box to improve your serve's effectiveness. Hitting the sidelines or targeting your opponent‚Äôs weak side can give you a strategic advantage.\nDevelop a Consistent Toss: A consistent toss helps in achieving a reliable serve. Practice your toss to ensure it‚Äôs at the right height and position every time.\n\n‚Äç\n\nRPPK Certification for Coaches\n\nFor those looking to take their pickleball skills to the next level and possibly share their knowledge with others, consider pursuing certification through the RPPK (Registered Pickleball Professional Coach) program. This program offers aspiring coaches a structured pathway to become certified and gain valuable experience. If you're interested in becoming a certified coach, visit DUPR's certification page to learn more.\n\n‚Äç\n\nConclusion\n\nImproving your pickleball skills takes dedication, practice, and a willingness to learn. By focusing on your pickleball grip, mastering essential pickleball shots, incorporating spin, enhancing your backhand, and refining your serve, you‚Äôll find yourself becoming a more well-rounded player. So grab your paddle, hit the courts, and enjoy the journey of becoming a better pickleball player! Happy playing!"}

Just two years ago, there hadn‚Äôt been a single collegiate event‚Äîand a year from now, we‚Äôll already be halfway through our fifth season. All the collegiate pickleball growth is due to the players and teams that show up to each tournament, bring their A-game, and continue to expand out their collegiate pickleball club at their school.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nBy the numbers, here‚Äôs how far we‚Äôve come:\n\nThe 2025 season events have been announced, you can read more on the upcoming season here! We will be adding more campus regionals and more dual matches into the calendar to foster localized competition. Our big change in 2025 will be moving the National Championship to be at the end of the spring semester instead of the fall. This means our next Nationals will be April 11th-13th, 2025!\n\n‚Äç\n\nNationals Numbers¬†\n\nGoing into the 2025 season, our defending champions will be the Utah Tech Trailblazers from St. George, Utah! After coming close to winning the first two National Championships, they finally clinched it with their stellar performance at the 2024 Nationals. They are the only champions to not drop a single game in the semifinals and finals, beating UNC 3-0 in the semis and UVA 3-0 in the finals. Those wins were significant too, as those were the two schools that had stopped Utah Tech from becoming the champion in 2022 (UNC) and 2023 (UVA).¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis tournament proved once again that you cannot underestimate the power of the fans in collegiate matchups. UNC and UVA brought the most players to the 2024 Nationals, and everyone in the building knew it with the cheering that occurred between each point. Those cheers powered UNC to a nailbiter win over Utah Valley in the quarterfinals, and UVA over Clemson in the semifinals.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nWith the 2025 Nationals only five months away, there were 24 bids given out at the 2024 Nationals to speed up the process.

Fans and players were hanging onto every point, especially in our FAU vs. Clemson and UNC vs. Utah Valley Dreambreakers in the quarterfinals.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWith the 3rd season of collegiate pickleball behind us, it has become clear that they are three collegiate pickleball ‚Äúblue bloods‚Äù. Schools that have been competitively dominant year after year, are very well organized, and are models for other schools to follow in both on-court and off-court success. These three schools are of course UNC, UVA, and Utah Tech. Here are some stats to show how dominant these blue bloods have been compared to the rest of the field:\n\n‚Äç\n\nBlue Bloods\n\nThe blue blood teams have only lost to themselves at Nationals, with the exception of TCU beating UVA in group play in 2022. Since each of those schools have been to two finals, it means there are no schools that have been to a single finals, either two or zero for each school.

Who will claim the title?", "url": "https://www.dupr.com/post/3-steps-to-build-mental-strength-to-dominate-on-the-pickleball-court", "content": "You're up 9-7 in the third game of a tournament match. Then everything falls apart.\n\n‚Äç\n\nOne bad shot leads to another. Your confidence crumbles. Your thoughts race. Before you know it, you've lost the match 11-9. Sound familiar? Most players focus solely on technique and tactics. Yet mental strength often determines who wins close matches. The good news? Mental strength can be trained.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHere's how to transform from a reactive player into a composed competitor who thrives under pressure.\n\n‚Äç\n\n1. Master Self-Regulation: Stop Emotional Spirals Before They Start\n\nWe've all watched a player implode after a few bad points.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTheir frustration snowballs into a complete meltdown, taking their game down with it.\n\n‚Äç\n\nStart with Awareness\n\nSelf-regulation begins with awareness. Many players tank because they aren't in control of their attention. Mindfulness trains attentional awareness and empowers you to understand your mental state. When you notice uncomfortable thoughts and emotions early, you can shift attention to positive action.\n\n‚Äç\n\nMaster Your Tools\n\nOnce awareness is established, you have several powerful tools you can use to regulate your state:\n\n‚ÄçBreathwork:\n\nExtended exhale breathing calms your nervous system during high-stress moments\nBox breathing (4-4-4-4) improves focus between points\nPractice these techniques during drills to make them automatic\nRelease-Reset-Refocus Framework:\nRelease: Make a conscious physical action to let go of the mistake and to deal with it later.\nClap your hands\nTap your paddle\nUse a specific phrase\nChoose one consistent signal to release negative energy\nReset: Ground yourself in the present moment using a physical or verbal cue.\nTake a deep breath\nCount to five\nDo a quick body scan\nRefocus: Direct your attention to what's important now (WIN). Focus your attention on something actionable, in your control, and present-focused.\nCheck opponent positioning\nFocus on your serve routine\nReturn to your game plan\n\nWhen you control your emotional state, you control the match. Your opponents can't rattle you.\n\n‚Äç\n\n2. Build Decision-Making Skills Under Pressure: Make Winning Choices When It Matters\n\nMost players freeze or panic in crucial moments.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTheir mind goes blank, and they resort to desperate low-percentage shots.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe CLEAR Framework\n\nAdapted from military decision-making models, CLEAR gives you a structured approach:\n\n‚ÄçCourt position: Where are you on the court?\n\nKitchen line\nMid-court\nBackcourt\nPosition determines your options\n\nLook: What's the tactical situation?\n\nOpponent positions\nCourt coverage\nMovement patterns\nIdentify vulnerabilities\n\nEvaluate: What's your highest percentage play?\n\nAvailable shots\nRisk vs reward\nScore context\nChoose based on position and patterns\n\nAct: Commit fully to your decision\n\nNo hesitation\nComplete follow-through\nTrust your preparation\n\nReset: Return to the one-point mentality\n\nUse Release-Reset-Refocus\nStay present\nPrepare for the next point\n\nBetter decisions in crucial moments lead directly to more wins.\n\n‚Äç\n\n3. Develop Resilience: Turn Setbacks into Comebacks\n\nEvery player faces setbacks, but few know how to learn from them.\n\n‚Äç\n\nMost either ignore failures or let them destroy their confidence.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe ADAPT Framework\n\nADAPT transforms setbacks into growth opportunities:\n\n‚ÄçAcknowledge: Face the setback without judgment\n\nProcess emotional response\nAccept the current reality\nCreate space for learning\n\nDistill: Extract specific lessons\n\nBreak down what happened\nIdentify patterns\nFind actionable insights\n\nAdjust: Modify your approach\n\nDevelop tactical solutions\nRefine mental game\nCreate specific practice plans\n\nPractice: Implement changes systematically\n\nFocus on deliberate practice\nProgressive challenge levels\nBuild new patterns\n\nTest: Evaluate in competition\n\nApply changes under pressure\nGather performance data\nContinue refining approach\n\nEach cycle through ADAPT builds both skill and mental toughness. The framework turns frustration into focused improvement.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Path Forward\n\nMental strength separates good players from great ones.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis isn't just about bouncing back ‚Äì it's about continuous growth. Start with self-regulation as your foundation. Build your decision-making framework through CLEAR. Use ADAPT to transform challenges into improvements. Practice these skills daily, not just during matches.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTraining your mental game requires the same dedication as technical skills. But the payoff is enormous. You'll stay composed under pressure. Make better decisions when it matters. Turn setbacks into comebacks.\n\n‚Äç\n\nNext Step:¬†\n\nChoose one aspect of self-regulation to practice this week. Notice when you get frustrated. Apply breathwork or Release-Reset-Refocus. Track your recovery time from setbacks.\n\n‚Äç\n\nRemember: Your mindset is a muscle. Train it consistently. Watch your game transform.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTo learn more, visit https://www.aim7.com/\n\n‚Äç\n\nBy Alex Auerbach, PhD & Erik Korem, PhD"}

Central to this rise is David Tabb, a pickleball enthusiast and event organizer whose nearly decade-long involvement has shaped the Florida pickleball scene into what it is today. Tabb‚Äôs events combine the spirit of fun with structured competition, fostering a community-driven environment that leaves participants feeling rejuvenated and eager for more.\n\n‚Äç\n\nA Passion for Pickleball: The Beginnings\n\nDavid Tabb‚Äôs journey with pickleball began almost nine years ago on a roller hockey rink in Holiday Park, Fort Lauderdale. Reflecting on those early days, Tabb says, \"I started playing about nine years ago before it was cool, and we played on a roller hockey rink here in Holiday Park, Fort Lauderdale.\" As the sport gained traction, he started organizing local drill sessions and small-scale events that laid the foundation for his larger endeavors. His early tournaments emphasized community, bringing people together for friendly competition. Over time, these events grew, evolving into more structured competitions while maintaining the lighthearted, fun atmosphere that Tabb is known for. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd always go out to lunch afterward, and we played tournaments. It was double elimination. You‚Äôd wait for a long time. Nobody knew how to tell what anybody was rated,‚Äù Tabb recalls.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Challenge of Ratings: Enter DUPR\n\nAs pickleball's popularity soared, so did the demand for competitive fairness. One major challenge Tabb faced early on was the lack of an accurate rating system for players, which made it difficult to run tournaments that fairly reflected players‚Äô skill levels. \"At the club in West Palm Beach, we actually had a competitive team... but we didn‚Äôt actually have ratings,\" Tabb says, explaining how difficult it was to organize skill-based events. That all changed when he was introduced to DUPR (Dynamic Universal Pickleball Rating), a tool that allowed for more consistent player ratings. This innovation helped take Tabb's tournaments to the next level, offering competitive, yet accessible, events where players of all levels could shine. He recalls, ‚ÄúI got introduced to Lee Whitwell... She introduced me to some guy named Tito, and Tito was like, ‚ÄòHey, we have this thing called DUPR Digital Club... Would you be interested?‚Äô‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nMinor League Pickleball\n\nDavid Tabb became the first Tournament Director to host a Minor League Pickleball event, a groundbreaking platform for both casual and competitive players to engage in high-energy tournaments that break away from the traditional mold. With locations like GT Bray Park in Bradenton, Florida, these events quickly became a hit, known for their focus on fun and creativity. Instead of adhering to rigid double-elimination formats, Tabb fostered an environment where players felt encouraged to take risks and attempt challenging shots. His catchphrase, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fun to do bad things,‚Äù became a playful rallying cry, inviting players to embrace the joy of the game rather than just focusing on winning.\n\nReflecting on these events, Tabb explains, ‚ÄúWe threw the first-ever amateur [minor league event] at GT Bray... It was a lot of fun. It was a mess, it was hilarious. There were spreadsheets and people playing on different courts at the same time, but it was a lot of fun.‚Äù Despite the initial chaos, the format was a hit, and requests for similar events began to pour in.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHalloween Event at All State FloridA, 2023\nMinor League Pickleball\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Key to Successful Tournaments: Fun and Emotional Engagement\n\nDavid Tabb‚Äôs success in hosting tournaments goes beyond pickleball skills‚Äîhis events thrive on emotional connection and community spirit. Whether it‚Äôs the rock music playing in the background or the unique, themed events, the goal is always to ensure that participants leave feeling both energized and emotionally connected to the game. His approach includes everything from fun costumes at events like ‚ÄúFright Against Cancer‚Äù to professional photographers capturing players' best moments. Tabb‚Äôs goal? ‚ÄúWe want you to feel refreshed, revived that you had a great experience, and you go and talk to your colleagues or your friends about the event on Monday.‚Äù\n\nTabb also emphasizes the community aspect: ‚ÄúYou never know what the person across from you is going through. Monday morning, there are people that are going back to their families who just got diagnosed with cancer, who just lost a loved one... but that weekend, they were able to escape and play and have fun.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nCreativity and Community: Enhancing the Tournament Experience\n\nTabb‚Äôs events stand out because of his creative touches. His ‚ÄúPimp My Paddle‚Äù station, where players can customize their paddles and outfits, is just one example of how he adds personal flair to every tournament. Additionally, themed tournaments like the holiday-inspired ‚ÄúReindeer Games‚Äù and quirky prizes turn his events into community celebrations that extend beyond the sport itself. ‚ÄúWe did one last year at Picktona... It was the ‚ÄòFright Against Cancer,‚Äô and we had people dressed up in Halloween costumes. I was running around as a bank robber,‚Äù Tabb says, reflecting on one of his fun-themed events. The emphasis is always on creating an inclusive environment where both seasoned players and newcomers feel welcome.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDavid Tabb‚Äôs Formula for Fun: Bringing Joy, Charity, and Community Together\n\nBeyond the fun, Tabb‚Äôs events often serve a higher purpose by supporting charitable causes. His tournaments frequently feature food drives and fundraisers that benefit local communities, turning a day of competition into something even more meaningful. Players can give back while enjoying the game, and the spirit of giving adds another layer to the experience. From his legendary pre-game speeches to quirky features like pumpkin carving contests during matches, Tabb knows how to make an event stand out.\n\nOne of Tabb‚Äôs signature touches is his attention to the emotional side of competition. ‚ÄúWe do long speeches... and we talk about charity, raising close to $100,000 this year. We also remind people that the person across from them might be going through something tough, but this weekend is their escape,‚Äù Tabb explains. He emphasizes that his tournaments are about more than just winning‚Äîthey‚Äôre about rejuvenation and connection.\n\n‚Äç\n\nConclusion: The Power of Fun and Community\n\nDavid Tabb‚Äôs journey is a testament to the power of combining passion, creativity, and community in sports. By focusing on emotional engagement and memorable experiences, Tabb has created a pickleball community that goes beyond the court. His tournaments are more than just games‚Äîthey‚Äôre opportunities for people to come together, support great causes, and share in the joy that pickleball brings.\n\n‚Äç\n\nRecommended Spotify Playlist: Upbeat Classic Rock\nNext Event: Bardmoor Betterball, November 14th\n\n‚Äç\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt yet experienced one of David‚Äôs events, you‚Äôre missing out on a pickleball tournament like no other. As he always says, ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs fun, we‚Äôre in!‚Äù\n\n‚Äç"}

Founder of National Junior Pickleball (NJP), Courtney Loughridge shares her experience with us: \"The energy and enthusiasm from players and families, along with the new friendships formed, exceeded every expectation,\" she shares, ‚ÄúFrom clinics to clinics to championship matches, each day was packed with excitement.‚Äù\n\nThe event kicked off with an engaging evening of clinics, which provided juniors with a chance to connect and break the ice before diving into three days of intense competition. The weekend unfolded with Singles, Doubles, and Team events, all set within a positive and competitive atmosphere. It was clear that NJP‚Äôs mission of fostering a community-centered tournament was alive and well.\n\nStandout Performances and Memorable Moments\n\n\"Our tournament was filled with incredible moments‚Äîfrom ATPs and hand battles to thrilling rallies, including a singles game that ended with a nail-biting 27-25 score,\" noted Courtney. The young athletes not only brought competitive spirit but also showcased remarkable sportsmanship and camaraderie‚Äîa hallmark of NJP events.\n\nAmong the highlights were the Gold Medal Champions in each Advanced age division. These players proudly hoisted the coveted golden Championship Cup and donned the exclusive Championship Cup jackets‚Äîa unique twist on the usual medal awards. Three players were also honored with Sportsmanship Awards, a tribute to their exceptional spirit, resilience, and kindness on and off the court.\n\nThe Rise of Junior Pickleball\n\nThis year has marked explosive growth in junior pickleball. NJP witnessed a surge in young beginners joining tournaments and a significant increase in girls' participation across all age divisions. \"We were thrilled to see an increase in girls' participation, especially in the 12U age group,\" shared Courtney. Offering divisions such as Girls Singles Advanced, Intermediate, and Beginner in this age group is a promising sign that young girls are embracing the sport with enthusiasm.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow DUPR Transformed the Tournament Experience\n\nThe DUPR rating system has been a game-changer for NJP, helping the organizers place players in appropriate skill divisions based on existing ratings and allowing newcomers to establish theirs. For many, NJP was their first competitive experience, and having their tournament results entered into DUPR has given players a clear sense of their skill level. This transparency and structure have enhanced the tournament experience for both beginner and intermediate players, who now have a tangible way to track their progress.\n\nLooking Ahead: The Future of NJP and Junior Pickleball\n\nNJP has big plans for the coming year, with a focus on expanding to new regions and increasing opportunities for young players to compete and connect.¬†\n\n\"Our goal is to reach more young players and give them accessible pathways to competitive play, regardless of their location or skill level,\" the team shared. NJP‚Äôs vision is to establish junior pickleball as a go-to sport for young athletes, from beginners to those aspiring to compete at elite levels.¬†\n\nAs NJP Founder Courtney expressed. \"Building a community where juniors and their families feel they truly belong is something I‚Äôm deeply passionate about.\"\n\nIn Houston, the NJP Championship Cup captured the essence of what junior pickleball is all about: community, competition, and joy. This year‚Äôs tournament will be remembered as a milestone, not only for the incredible performances and surprises but for the friendships and memories forged along the way.¬†\n\nThe future of junior pickleball looks bright, and we can‚Äôt wait to see what next year holds!\n\n‚Äç\n\nNext stop: The Western Regional in California!

The type of pickleball you choose can impact your game, whether you‚Äôre playing indoors or outdoors. These pickleballs are designed for different conditions, and understanding their characteristics can enhance your performance.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleballs are specialized plastic balls with a lightweight construction and perforated design that help control flight and bounce, making them suitable for various play environments. Let‚Äôs explore what sets these two types of pickleballs apart and how they impact your performance.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleballs guidelines\n\nThese parameters ensure consistency and quality:\n\nMust be 2.87-2.97 inches in diameter\nMust weigh between 0.78 and 0.935 ounces¬†\nMust have a bounce of 30-34 inches when dropped from a height of 78 inches\nA minimum of 26 and a maximum of 40 holes\nUniform color and untextured surface\n\nBased on these guidelines, pickleball companies have made specific design adjustments for both indoor and outdoor play.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIndoor Pickleballs\n\nThe softer material and reduced bounce of indoor pickleballs make them ideal for controlled environments.

Knowing the official pickleball rules will help you enjoy the game and compete at your best, whether you're playing singles or doubles, indoors or outdoors. In this post, we'll cover the basic pickleball rules, the differences between singles and doubles play, and highlight important concepts like pickleball scoring rules and pickleball kitchen rules.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBasic Pickleball Rules\n\nPickleball is played on a 20x44-foot court with a net in the middle. The game begins with a serve, where the server hits the ball underhand and diagonally across the net to the opponent‚Äôs service area. The ball must clear the non-volley zone (commonly called the kitchen) and land in the opponent‚Äôs diagonal service box.\n\nServing: The serve must be underhand, and the ball must be struck below the waist. The server must be positioned behind the baseline and serve the ball diagonally. Only one serve attempt is allowed.\nDouble Bounce Rule: After the serve, the ball must bounce once on each side of the net before either team can begin volleying (hitting the ball in the air without letting it bounce). This ensures a more controlled start to each rally.\nFaults: A fault occurs when a player fails to return the ball, hits the ball out of bounds, or violates other key rules like stepping into the kitchen while volleying (more on that later).\n\n‚Äç\n\nOfficial Pickleball Rules for Singles and Doubles\n\nWhile the pickleball rules singles and pickleball rules doubles share many similarities, there are some key differences:\n\nSingles Play: In singles pickleball, each player is responsible for covering the entire court. The serving player switches sides after every point. For example, if you serve from the right side and win the point, your next serve will come from the left side. Scoring in singles is simpler, as there is no need to alternate service between partners.\nDoubles Play: In doubles pickleball, each player has a partner, and only the serving team can score points. After the first serve of the game, both partners have a chance to serve before the serve is turned over to the opponents (this is called \"side-out\"). The server starts on the right side of the court and alternates between sides after each point.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleball Scoring Rules\n\nPickleball uses a rally scoring system. In pickleball doubles, only the serving team can score a point, while in pickleball singles, the server scores when they win the rally. A game is typically played to 11 points, and a team must win by two points. Tournaments may sometimes require games to be played to 15 or 21 points, with the same win-by-two rule.\n\nIn doubles, each partner gets a chance to serve before the serve goes to the opposing team. The exception is at the start of the game when only one partner on the initial serving team serves before the serve changes sides.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleball Kitchen Rules\n\nThe kitchen, also known as the non-volley zone, is a 7-foot area on both sides of the net. Pickleball kitchen rules are crucial to understand, as they prevent players from dominating at the net by volleying (hitting the ball in the air) too close to the net.\n\nPlayers cannot volley the ball while standing in or making contact with the kitchen.\nIt‚Äôs also a fault if your momentum carries you into the kitchen after volleying.\nHowever, players are allowed to enter the kitchen to hit a ball that has bounced, provided they exit before the next volley.\n\nThese kitchen rules help keep the game fair and balanced, encouraging strategy and finesse over power and domination at the net.\n\n‚Äç\n\nConclusion\n\nUnderstanding official pickleball rules is key to playing well and enjoying the game, whether you're a beginner or an experienced player. From pickleball rules singles and doubles to the nuances of the pickleball kitchen rules, knowing the ins and outs of this sport ensures a fair and fun experience for everyone involved. With clear pickleball scoring rules, anyone can quickly pick up the game and compete in no time. So, grab a paddle, head to the court, and start playing pickleball!"}

Learn about its origins and the story behind the name.", "url": "https://www.dupr.com/post/pickleball-the-fastest-growing-sport-in-america", "content": "Pickleball is a dynamic sport that combines elements of tennis, badminton, and table tennis, and it has quickly become one of the most popular activities across the U.S. Played on a court with a low net, players use paddles to hit a perforated plastic ball back and forth. The game can be played as singles or doubles, making it versatile and suitable for all ages and skill levels. It‚Äôs easy to learn, which makes it accessible for newcomers, yet competitive enough for seasoned athletes.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleball Explained\n\nPickleball‚Äôs simplicity is part of its charm. The smaller court size and slower ball speed make it less physically demanding than tennis, while still providing enough challenge to engage players. Whether you‚Äôre playing indoors or outdoors, the game‚Äôs pace can be adjusted to match the setting, adding to its flexibility. Indoor pickleball is typically played on gym floors, while outdoor pickleball is usually on tennis or pickleball courts, where players contend with weather elements, adding to the fun.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Role of DUPR\n\nAn exciting aspect of the pickleball sport is the DUPR (Dynamic Universal Pickleball Rating) system. DUPR helps players assess their skill levels by analyzing match results and performance, offering an accurate rating that ensures fair competition. Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or an advanced player, DUPR makes it easy to find suitable opponents, fueling the competitive aspect of the game.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhy Is Pickleball Called Pickleball?\n\nA common question many have is, \"Why is pickleball called pickleball?\" The origin story is fun and fitting for such a playful sport. Legend has it that the game was named after the Pritchards‚Äô dog, Pickles, who used to chase after the ball during games. Another theory suggests the name came from ‚Äúpickle boat,‚Äù a rowing term referring to a crew made up of leftover rowers from different teams, which reflects pickleball‚Äôs mix of various sports.\n\n‚Äç\n\nCelebrity Appeal and Global Expansion\n\nPickleball‚Äôs reach extends beyond casual backyard games, with celebrities like Shaquille O'Neal and Barack Obama picking up paddles, adding to its widespread appeal. As the sport grows, so does its player base, with millions now playing worldwide. The sport is also gaining traction globally, from Canada to Europe, Asia, and beyond.\n\n‚Äç\n\nA Sport for Everyone\n\nPickleball‚Äôs blend of fun, fitness, and social engagement makes it appealing to a wide audience. Whether you‚Äôre playing indoors to escape the elements or enjoying outdoor pickleball under the sun, this versatile sport offers something for everyone. Thanks to DUPR and its global rise, pickleball is not just a game‚Äîit‚Äôs a community.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTo start your own pickleball journey and track your progress, explore more about DUPR and pickleball events at www.dupr.com."}

Initially attracted to pickleball's social vibe, Noe has become competitive, participating in tournaments and making strides in his career, including being drafted into Major League Pickleball (MLP).\n\nBalancing a full-time job as an auditor, Noe looks forward to focusing solely on pickleball. He shares memorable experiences, admires tennis legend Rafael Nadal, discusses his training, and aspires to win bigger titles soon in his emerging pickleball career. Excited about the sport's growth, Noe is ready and eager to shape his future in pickleball!\n\n‚Äç\n\nFind out more about Noe on this Q&A:\n\n‚Äç\n\n\nHow and where did you find pickleball?\nI discovered pickleball at my local gym when I was living in Chicago. I saw people playing indoors on a basketball court and I was like \" What the hell is this?\". I tried it and loved it!\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow has it changed your life?\nAt first I was just playing for fun. Then I was missing competing so I decided to start playing a couple tournaments. I was doing well and the sport started exploding so I became interested in trying to play the professional circuit. Now I can't imagine my life without pickleball whether with friends for fun or competitively. Fun Fact I also met my girlfriend at a pickleball tournament!\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat is your favorite memory from your career so far?\nUtah PPA was a great memory. I was sick and almost didnt play the tournament but I ended up beating Dylan Frazier and Jay Devilier making the quarterfinals. I also made the quarterfinals in doubles and played the Johns brothers on Center Court for the first time so it was pretty cool! I was also very excited when I got drafted by Miami for MLP. Finally, my girlfriend and I qualified for Mixed Pro Main Draw in our first PPA together!\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat motivated you to become a pro pickleball player?\nI love competing and the atmosphere in tournaments. I also enjoy traveling and discovering new places. Ideally I would love to make a living out of it.\n\n‚Äç\n\nNoe at PPA Tournament\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat has been the most fun about joining Major League Pickleball? What has been a challenge?\nJoining Major League Pickleball was very exciting. It's fun to compete as a team against the best players out there. Getting used to the format and atmosphere was the most challenging I would say.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat athlete or person inspires you the most?\nMy idol growing up was Rafael Nadal. I love the way he competes and fight on every point. He is one of the toughest athlete out there mentally and physically.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat does your current training regimen look like?\nI have a full time job as an Auditor at Deloitte right now so I havent been able to train as much as I can unfortunately. I usually hit the gym early in the morning before work and try to drill after work. I will go full time pickleball starting July 20th so I am excited about the idea to be able to train more.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat is your greatest accomplishment in sports so far?\nWon the French National Championship (tennis) in singles when I was 14 and in doubles when I was 12 and 16. Also won a Big Ten title playing for the University of Illinois.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat do you do outside of pickleball?\nI have a full time Job as an Auditor at Deloitte. I also love playing golf whenever I have time and watching sport or tv shows.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat is your current DUPR?\nCurrently it is 6.333 in Doubles and 6.579 in Singles.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat is the biggest title you would like to achieve in your pickleball career?\nWin gold medals in Singles and Doubles on different pro tour events, and of course Win MLP.\n‚Äç\nWhat did you feel like getting drafted to play for MPC?\nI was very excited when I got the news I got drafted. That was one of my goal this season and I‚Äôm very happy to have the opportunity to compete as part of an MLP team.\nNoe with doubles partner Bobbi Oshiro at MLP NYC\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow was the first MLP event of the season for you in terms of nerves, atmosphere, and team chemistry?\nI really enjoyed my first MLP event. We had some really close matches which was very exciting. It took me a little bit of time to get used to the new format and different atmosphere, but thankfully I have an amazing team that helped me with this transition and I feel better and better with every match I play.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow does the MLP format feel compared to playing PPA's or other non-team events?\nMLP format makes things very interesting because anything can happen. Every point matters and each game is usually very close, so you have to be all-in from the first point to the last point. I like competing as part of a team, because you are playing for something bigger than yourself. It gives additional motivation.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat are your team and personal goals for this season?\nOur goal as a team is to finish on top of the Challenger standings and get promoted to Premier. My personal goal is to help the team achieve its goal and to give myself the opportunity to compete in the premier league next year.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAnything else you want to add?\nIt's good to see pickleball growing the way it has been over the last couple of years, allowing professional players to focus full-time on their pickleball career.

Join the community and improve your game with reliable player ratings.", "url": "https://www.dupr.com/post/a-step-by-step-guide-to-dominate-tournament-season", "content": "Pickleball tournament season can be grueling. Players often face fatigue, poor performance, and injury risk.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nBut it doesn't have to be this way.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nWith the right strategy, you can maintain peak performance throughout the season. This guide will show you how to prepare, train, and recover effectively. You'll learn the necessary skills to achieve your performance potential while staying healthy.\n\n‚Äç\n\nStep 1: Build Your Match Volume\n\nMany players underestimate the demands of tournament play. This leads to inadequate preparation and subpar performance.\n\n‚Äç\n\nYou must be well prepared for the worst-case scenario regarding the maximum pickleball you may need to play over a multi-day tournament. For example, if you play singles, doubles, and mixed doubles in a large field, you could play up to 5 (five) x 30-minute matches daily.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThat‚Äôs almost 8 hours of matchplay.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nAnd these aren‚Äôt just normal matches. These maximum-intensity matches will drain your physical and mental energy, and that‚Äôs not even considering the challenges of playing on the road, away from your home court.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe first step to dominating the tournament season is increasing your match play volume.\n\n‚Äç\n\nCalculate the difference between your weekly match play volume and the projected tournament volume. If you currently play 4 hours of competitive match play per week, the difference is 4 hours.\n\n‚Äç\n\nNext, increase your weekly match play volume, in minutes, by 10-15% until you reach tournament volume.\n\nWeek 1: 276 min (+15%)\n\nWeek 2: 317 min (+15%)\n\nWeek 3: 365 min (+15%)\n\nWeek 4: 420 min (+15%)\n\nWeek 5: 460 min (+10%)\n\n‚Äç\n\nFollowing these steps to build the matchplay volume required for grueling tournaments.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nStep 2: Increase Intensity\n\nTournament match play will challenge you both physically and mentally, and if you aren‚Äôt prepared to sustain a high level of intensity, your play will deteriorate over time.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIn addition to accumulating more volume of match play, you should deliberately intensify your on-court and off-court training leading up to a tournament season.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHere's how to push your limits and see real growth:\n\nOn-Court\n\nChallenge yourself against superior opponents to increase physical and mental training stress.\nCreate scenarios where you are down several points at the end of a match and must overcome negative momentum to win.\n\nOff-Court\n\nFour to six weeks before the tournament season begins, incorporate lactic power training to enhance stamina for singles play and develop a mental edge.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe primary goal of lactic power training is to improve the body's ability to produce energy quickly in the absence of oxygen (anaerobically) and increase tolerance to the accumulation of lactic acid, which can cause muscle fatigue and a burning sensation. This type of training is often incorporated into sports that require repeated bursts of high-intensity efforts, such as pickleball, soccer, basketball, or hockey.\n\n‚Äç\n\nKey components of lactic power training:\nHigh Intensity: Exercises are performed at near-maximal effort (80-95% of your maximum heart rate).\nShort Duration: Work intervals last between 30 seconds to 2 minutes.\nRecovery Periods: Rest between sets is often 2-4 times the length of the work interval to allow partial recovery.\nRepeated Efforts: Typically, multiple sets of these high-intensity efforts are performed with the goal of increasing tolerance to lactate.\n\n‚Äç\n\nI recommend removing lactic power training seven to ten days before your first tournament. In addition, consider performing the sessions off the court (e.g., biking, rowing, sprinting, etc.) to prevent injury.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nStep 3: Optimize Your Weekly Training Schedule\n\nMany players fail to structure their training week effectively. This results in fatigue, inconsistent performance, and increased injury risk. During a competitive season, your goals during the training weeks are to:\n\nRecover from the previous event\nRefine your skills & enhance your tactics without inducing excessive fatigue\nPrime your brain and body for the upcoming event¬†¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nHere's a winning weekly schedule:\n\nMonday: Focus on recovery with active and proper nutrition\nTuesday: High intensity/moderate volume court session + strength training\nWednesday: Low intensity/low volume court session\nThursday: Implement stimulatory practice to prime your body for competition\nFriday-Sunday: Dominate tournament play with peak performance\n\n‚Äç\n\nDownload our FREE AIM7 training calendar for more details on the optimal weekly training schedule to help you win more matches.\n\n‚Äç\n\nStep 4: Stimulate Don‚Äôt Annihilate!\n\nThe two mistakes I see players making before a tournament that leads to predictably poor performance are:\n\nOvertraining the week before the tournament and failing to perform to their potential.\nMismanaging recovery and resting too much. In this case, they start slow and lose early in the tournament.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHere's how to prevent these mistakes and prime yourself for success:\n\nMove your mid-week recovery day to Wednesday (T-2) for a Friday start date.\nOn Thursday (T-1), implement a short, intense court session to stimulate your nervous system for the tournament's first day.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis strategy ensures you prevent a sluggish start by priming your body for performance.\n\n‚Äç\n\nStep 5: Master Long-Term Tournament Season Management\n\nMany players burn out during extended tournament seasons because they fail to account for the compounding effects of consecutive tournaments.\n\nThis leads to declining performance and increased injury risk.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHere's a strategy to maintain peak form during a long competitive season of back-to-back tournaments.\n\n‚Äç\n\nMaintain your weekly training structure for the first 1-3 consecutive weekends. Give your body time to adapt to the rigors of a competitive season. After a month of tournament competition, lower your weekly training volume (on-court time & strength training volume) but maintain a high level of intensity on key training days.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAt this point of the season, fitness shouldn‚Äôt be an issue, and the goal should be to refine your skill, maximize recovery, and level up your play each weekend. Also, listen to your body! Just because you have a plan on paper doesn‚Äôt mean you need to follow it.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWrap Up\n\nPerforming at your best during tournament season requires a strategic approach to training and recovery. By building match volume, increasing intensity, optimizing your weekly schedule, and mastering long-term management, you'll set yourself up for success.\n\nRemember, the key is balance. Push yourself in training, but don't overtrain. Recover actively, but don't become sluggish. And always listen to your body ‚Äì it's your best guide throughout the season.\n\n‚Äç"}

While studying sport psychology at Indiana University, she secured two first-place trophies at the 2024 College Individual National Championship (CINC).\n\n‚Äç\n\nLearn more about her insights and advice below! (Responses were transcribed from a video interview and edited by Charles Smith.)\n\n‚Äç\n\nTell us about your background in tennis and what inspired you to pursue it at a higher level.\n‚ÄçI started playing competitive tennis at a very young age ‚Äîsome might say I was born with a racket in hand. I'm the youngest of three girls, and they both played. I just picked it up in the park and then played with my sisters. Others recognized some potential in me, highlighting that it was something that was worth continuing to pursue.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat challenges did you face transitioning from collegiate tennis to life without competitive play?\nI had a difficult time transitioning out of tennis because it was such a big part of my life. Then pretty soon after I found pickleball, which was great because it was something new, but familiar. I felt I was able to pick it up pretty quickly. The tennis background helps you be a decent pickleball player, but it‚Äôs not enough to be a great pickleball player. I actually think that my tennis background helped me and hurt me. It helped me with the basics, but I've had to unlearn a lot of tennis tendencies that have hurt me in pickleball.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhich mental techniques or strategies have been effective for you or other athletes that you've worked with when competing at an elite level?\nI've actually had the opportunity through my schooling and training to work with collegiate athletes on mental performance. I think a couple things that I would say have been helpful for me and have often been helpful for athletes include going into practice or even competition and looking at it as a positive opportunity. So an opportunity to compete, exercise, have fun, and implement the things that you've been working on. I think that it can be helpful to take a step back and have perspective. It is just a game and the sun will rise tomorrow. There are a lot of really difficult things going on in the world, and I think having that perspective can really help elite athletes perform at a higher level as well as just enjoy the sport more.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nWatch Mehv's full interview on our YouTube channel!\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat advice would you give to current athletes who are approaching the end of their collegiate or sports professional career?¬†\nI'm actually working on my dissertation research right now for my PhD program. My focus is helping athletes navigate the transition out of collegiate sports, so it's important to recognize who you are outside of just being an athlete.\nThe stronger adherence you have to your athletic identity can really hurt you mentally. So recognizing that there's more to you than just being an athlete or recognizing that even those traits or skills that you possess as an athlete can transfer to other aspects of your life can be really helpful when transitioning out of sports, whether it's at a collegiate or professional level.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDo you have any hopes for the impact your research could have?¬†\nI think that the ultimate goal is that the research translates into practice in some way. In sport psychology, a lot of the research is based around how we optimize performance outcomes on various psychological or mental skills.¬†\nI'm also trying to bring an emphasis to how we can help athletes transition out of sports. For my dissertation, I'm trying to look into programming specifically that will help athletes have an easier transition out of collegiate athletics. There's a lot of research on the challenges that student athletes will experience, but there's not a ton of research on how we take those results and then create programming that will actually help them with the issue.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nWere there any resources or support systems that helped you transition out of collegiate sports?¬†\nI could have really used someone like my current self or any sport psychology consultant or mental performance coach when I was a college student athlete. I think even if you're not engaged in traditional programming or if programming isn't out there to help you transition out of sport, it's really important to lean on your social supports and talk to other former student athletes and normalize that difficult transition.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nYou performed great at THE DUPR CINC 2024, getting first place twice in mixed doubles and women's singles! How did those wins feel and what was your experience with the overall competition?\nI was playing for Indiana University (IU), and IU pickleball was born very recently, so we created a competitive team in the fall of 2022. This year was our first showing at the Collegiate Individual Nationals.¬†\nI think we had a good showing all around for it being our first time there. It was in Cincinnati, Ohio, which is home for me, so it was extra special. My parents were there and we played at the facility that I started playing tennis at. That was extra cool, and it was a really fun experience.¬†\nWe got to play a lot of matches within a couple of days: I played 23 matches in two days, which is wild. I had a couple of very bruised toenails after the tournament. Also, I got to meet a lot of new people. Everyone's really friendly at these college tournaments, and DUPR does a great job of creating a very organized environment and also an environment that's just fun and friendly. DUPR also takes very good care of the athletes too.\nOur team had a few coaches there: Timber Tucker, Courtney and Kirby Shedd. They all volunteered their time and energy to help grow the IU pickleball team and support collegiate pickleball. That was great having them there. I got two titles while I was there which was exciting, and I got to make some money along the way. It was a really great weekend overall!\n\n‚Äç\n\nKeep up with Mehvish's journey on Instagram, and check out her team Indiana University Pickleball Club!\n\n‚Äç\n\nWritten By: Charles Smith\n\n‚Äç"}

They are present on all fronts and are always looking for more initiatives to be involved with. For a brand like Osaka entering a new space with pickleball, this is what you look for in partners.¬†¬†\n\n¬†\n\nThe DUPR team‚Äôs excitement for what is to come in pickleball has been infectious. We hope that the collaboration between DUPR and Osaka brings many successes, building up from Collegiate Pickleball to more joint ventures in the future.¬†¬†\n\n¬†\n\nWhy is Osaka looking to enter into the pickleball space? How do you view this sport and the opportunities within? ¬†\n\nSince 2022, it has been clear that Osaka will eventually enter the pickleball market. With 38M players in the US and a 40% increase in new members YoY, it has become the fastest growing sport in the US by a mile.¬†¬†\n\n¬†\n\nFor those who do not know Osaka, we can be considered as an up-and-coming brand for up-and-coming sports. We believe that passion for a sports brand comes from the right balance between fashion and function. People are not just looking for a high performing racquet or paddle anymore. They are always on the lookout for what is going to become the next cool thing. This is what we believe to be our edge at Osaka, where we have had a central focus on stylish, contemporary, and unique designs.¬†\n\n¬†\n\nWith pickleball, we aim to have the same success as with other sports, by bringing a lifestyle approach paired with top-of-the-line equipment. We are ready to take on this great challenge.¬†¬†\n\n¬†¬†\n\nWhat do you hope to gain from this partnership? ¬†\n\nWith this partnership, we hope to bring brand awareness and gain more exposure to the pickleball market, reach a large audience, and connect with players at events nationwide.¬†¬†\n\n¬†\n\nThe collegiate events part of this partnership is particularly important to us. A successful strategy for the Osaka team has been to focus on activations at events and connect with players by providing them with a distinct experience. First impressions matter. Being able to display your brand and what you stand for in front of thousands is an opportunity we could not pass on. There is no better way to get a positive momentum with the people you connect with.¬†¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nOnce we have established that first connection with the players, we accompany them throughout their development. We are there every step of the way and can give them access to high-performance equipment from entry-level to elite. And because of our lifestyle approach, we are constantly developing more collections to appeal to our young and older customers and give them that sense of community.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nWe look forward to attending our first DUPR events. To all college players, you are in for a treat!¬†\n\n¬†\nWhat do you hope this partnership offers to collegiate pickleball players? ¬†\n¬†‚ÄòWhy fit in when you were born to stand out?'\n\nThis has been at the core of everything we do at Osaka. On top of the unique design identity, one of our key strengths is to adopt a lifestyle approach to all our sports. We recognize that people are not just playing a sport for the health benefits of it. People have a need to be a part of a community. And that is exactly who we want to target in the marketing of our brand. Once you give an athlete a sense of belonging through your brand, they will stay loyal to you.¬†\n\nWe hope to bring this sense of community to all the collegiate players we will meet and interact with during our partnership with DUPR. We hope to bring them a new brand that will appeal to them and stand out from the masses.¬†¬†\n\n¬†\n\nWhat was particularly appealing to you about the collegiate pickleball space?¬†\n\nCollegiate athletes represent the strongest segment of our customer base. They sit at the forefront when it comes to adopting unique brands, new products and embracing new innovations. They are the disruptors we hope to collaborate with to bring our brand to new heights.¬†¬†\n\nAs the sport grows in popularity and professionalizes itself, college players will become the next (inter)national athletes and ambassadors for our brand.¬†¬†\n\n¬†¬†\n\nTo learn more about Okaka's partnership with DUPR, click here.\n\n‚Äç"}

A Provisional DUPR can only be created by a certified DUPR Coach and rates 18 skill sets of a player‚Äôs game, including shot selection, court positioning, partner chemistry, and technical skills.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR Coach empowers coaches to¬† generate Provisional DUPRs for the 34 million non-rated pickleball players in the U.S. using a simple technology tool.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBrian Lloyd, Chief Pickleball Officer of Dill Dinkers, remarked: ‚ÄúSince pickleball is primarily played in a doubles format, the enjoyment and growth of the game require parity of skills. If one player is lower (or higher) in skill level, it impacts the quality of the match for all four players. The Provisional DUPR tool is a high-fidelity way for a player to truly have their skills analyzed by certified DUPR Coaches. This allows players to start their individualized development plan while enabling coaches the ability to support them from anywhere. It allows clubs to run more enjoyable or competitive events, like open plays or round robins, and caters to those new to the sport with the knowledge to register for the ‚Äòright‚Äô event. As a coach, I simply open an app on my phone and produce a Provisional DUPR in a few minutes.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nBrian continues, ‚ÄúThe pickleball industry has a very rare opportunity to transform millions of non-rated players into active, engaged members. For coaches, DUPR Coach is the most important tool a coach can have; their phone is now a member engagement device.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nDavid Kempster, Director of Racquets at The Peninsula Golf and Country Club, a Troon Club, emphasized the importance of why Provisional DUPRs are needed for the growth of the game: \"When you provide a non-rated player who‚Äôs relatively new to the game with a Provisional DUPR and grow their skills to a 3.5 DUPR, it creates a long-term member. DUPR Coach enables me to rapidly assess a player‚Äôs skills‚Äîlike nothing I‚Äôve ever seen. I now run the DUPR Assessment sessions monthly so players can see where they are and how good they can be.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nGavin Leon, Director of Racquets at Baltimore Country Club (BCC), a private club with over 5,000 members, highlights the importance of the Provisional DUPR: ‚ÄúFor pickleball's growth to be sustainable and non-rated members to better engage and enjoy the sport, there must be a standard for matching players‚Äô skill levels. Similar to the GHIN Handicap in golf, DUPR provides players with an objective way to measure their skill level so they can have the most fun playing competitively. As a DUPR Coach, I can now rapidly generate Provisional DUPRs and develop skills for hundreds of newcomers. At The Baltimore Country Club, coaches now have a new program to welcome non-rated DUPR players. Already, we have seen this approach improve membership growth and retention.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nJeff Rausch, Director of Pickleball at the Austin Pickle Ranch, expressed his enthusiasm for the impact of Provisional DUPRs for both players and facilities: ‚ÄúBefore DUPR Coach, our assessments helped players understand their skill level, but they lacked the formal recognition needed to take action. Now, with Provisional DUPRs, coaches at the Austin Pickle Ranch will be able to accurately assess players and provide them with a globally recognized rating to kick-start their DUPR journey. This not only helps our members better understand their abilities but enables all players to join skill-based play at their appropriate level. The introduction of Provisional DUPRs is a crucial step in ensuring the sport‚Äôs long-term success by creating fair, fun, and competitive play at our facility and beyond.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe DUPR Coach provides coaches with a new revenue stream through DUPR Skills Assessment Events, which are designed for coaches and clubs to elevate their pickleball offerings and boost revenue. These events come with a robust revenue model. Attendees receive a Provisional DUPR, helping them understand their current skill level and set goals for improvement, and they receive long-term personalized coaching that keeps them engaged while they improve.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTito Machado, CEO of DUPR stated: ‚ÄúCoaches are the lifeblood of pickleball, and the DUPR Coach tool is meant to empower coaches in their efforts to bring more players into the game and create even more engaging pickleball opportunities for all levels. Pickleball is still on a remarkable global growth trajectory and supporting coaches with the ability to assign players Provisional DUPRs will make their entry into pickleball even more enjoyable and ultimately keep them on the court for years to come.

It gives players a rating based on match results and helps them find more opportunities to play. Everyone can use DUPR ‚Äì whether you‚Äôre a recreational player, club warrior, or a pro. It‚Äôs free to use and makes pickleball even more fun.\n\nDUPR‚Äôs rating system is based on match results, so it provides the most reliable assessment of player level in an easy-to-understand way. All players, regardless of their age, gender, location, or skill, are rated on the same scale between 2.000-8.000. Here‚Äôs what the rating looks at: The algorithm considers four factors:\n\nPoints ‚Äì If you win 11-3, you go up more than if you win 11-9. Competing against similar-level players will have a greater impact on your rating.\nRecency ‚Äì When entering matches, more recent matches will move you more than old matches.\nTotal Match Count ‚Äì If you‚Äôve played in a lot of matches, your rating will fluctuate less compared to a player with a lower match count.\nEvery Match Matters ‚Äì Every match counts toward your rating, even if you are playing against someone who is unrated or new to DUPR.\n\nWhen players have a rating, it makes playing even more fun. Players can find more opportunities to play with others at their level and track their progress, and clubs and tournaments use DUPR to create better competition. It‚Äôs a language that unifies the game across age, gender, skill level, and location. If you have a rating on DUPR, you can find fun pickleball play wherever you are. ¬†\n\nWhen people first signed up for DUPR, we saw some very strange ratings (e.g., a beginner with just one or two games getting a strangely high ranking). Why does that happen? And how long is it before a typical DUPR rating is ‚Äúaccurate?‚Äù\n\nJust like any system, the more information (i.e. match results) that DUPR has, the better the system is at evaluating a player‚Äôs skill level because it has a bigger pool of results to analyze. A player who is just starting may see their rating fluctuate a bit before it levels out to offer a more reliable assessment of their skill level. DUPR recently introduced a Reliability Score, which is a percentage that indicates a player‚Äôs progress toward achieving a reliable rating to help players understand their rating.\n\nPlayers who have more results in DUPR will have higher reliability scores because there are more match results to analyze, offering a more in-depth view of their ability. A player who is just starting will have a lower reliability score because DUPR does not have as many results to analyze. As players play more and share their results with DUPR, their ratings become more and more reliable, and their reliability scores will go up.\n\nA player‚Äôs Reliability Score reflects a few things ‚Äì how many match results are in our system, how recently they‚Äôve played, and the variety of players they‚Äôve played against. A higher Reliability Score means the player is consistently uploading match results to the system, while a lower score indicates that there is some catching up (i.e., more playing!) to be done.\n\nThere isn‚Äôt necessarily a set time frame that a player can follow to achieve a reliable rating. Instead, DUPR recommends focusing on the following:\n\nPlay with various partners and opponents.\nPlay against similarly rated opponents.\nPlay club/tournament matches.\nPlay against highly reliable players.\n\nThese are the key factors in ensuring a player has a reliable rating. .\n\nWhat are DUPR‚Äôs main aims/mission? And how are they playing out in Asia?\n\nDUPR‚Äôs mission is to unify pickleball across age, gender, and location with a simple rating system while fostering a sense of fairness and competition for pickleball players across the globe. The players in Asia are fantastic, and the numbers are growing. ¬†Pickleball clubs are sprouting up at an amazing rate. You can find a club to play in almost every country in Asia. Tourists from all over the globe have added pickleball to their travel itinerary as a fun way to meet locals and log some games in different countries (like a digital souvenir!). ¬†Asia also has many high-level players playing in the PPA, MLP, & Major League Pickleball Australia.\n\nWhich are the most active DUPR countries around Asia right now?\n\nThe Philippines, China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Chinese Taipei have been very active lately. ¬†These countries are uploading scores through tournaments, leagues, team formats, and open play. ¬†\n\nIf you meet a player and they say, ‚ÄúWhy should I bother signing up for DUPR?‚Äù what are the main reasons you give them?\n\nDUPR makes sure that games are fair, which leads to more interesting matches and gameplay.\nYou can keep track of your progress and see where you‚Äôre doing well and where you need to improve, which is very important for getting better at the game.\nThe ratings help event organizers set the seeds, which makes tournaments more competitive and well-organized.\nDUPR‚Äôs universal method promotes inclusion by not caring about age or gender, making the facility a friendly place for all pickleball fans.\nIt is an international benchmark for assessing pickleball skills as the sport gains global popularity, crucial for international tournaments and monitoring players‚Äô proficiency worldwide.\nWhen players are rated on DUPR, they can find fun, competitive opportunities to play wherever they are in the world.\n\nOutside of ratings is there anything DUPR and the DUPR app can be used for?\n\nYes! ¬†You can use the platform to find players of similar skill levels in your area so that you can play with them! ¬†You can also see where you rank inside the digital club that you have joined this helps fan the flames of friendly competition. You can also DM players directly through the app to stay connected! ¬†The app also can be used for DUPR Feeds, which allow you to:\n\nFollow Friends: Stay in the loop with your pickleball pals!

Learn how DUPR can help elevate your game to the next level.", "url": "https://www.dupr.com/post/exploring-pickleball-court-surfaces-which-is-best-for-your-game", "content": "When it comes to pickleball, the playing surface can significantly impact your game. Whether you're a beginner learning the ropes or a seasoned pro honing your skills, understanding the different court surfaces and their characteristics is essential for optimizing your performance. In this guide, we'll dive into the various types of pickleball court surfaces and explore which one might be best suited for your playing style.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Importance of Pickleball Ratings and the DUPR System\n\n‚Äç\n\nBefore we dive into the specifics of pickleball court surfaces, it's crucial to highlight the role of pickleball ratings and DUPR (Dynamic Universal Pickleball Rating) presented by Delaware Life. As the premier global pickleball rating system and technology platform, DUPR provides players with dynamic ratings that accurately reflect their skill level. Trusted by leading clubs, tournaments, and players worldwide, DUPR Pickleball Ratings, Skill Levels & Rankings ensure fair competition and promote player development across age, gender, and location.\n\n‚Äç\n\nUnderstanding your DUPR rating is paramount for assessing your progress, finding suitable opponents, and participating in competitive play. Whether you're striving to climb the ranks or simply aiming to improve your game, DUPR offers valuable insights into your performance and allows you to track your journey in the world of pickleball.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHard Court Surfaces\n\n‚Äç\n\nHard courts, typically made of concrete or asphalt, are among the most popular surfaces for pickleball. These surfaces offer consistent ball bounce and relatively fast gameplay, making them ideal for competitive matches. Additionally, hard courts require minimal maintenance and are durable enough to withstand heavy foot traffic, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor play, such as the US Open.\n\n‚Äç\n\nOne of the key advantages of hard courts is their versatility. They can be found in various settings, including community centers, recreational facilities, and dedicated pickleball courts. Furthermore, hard courts allow players to execute precise shots with ease, enhancing the overall experience of the game.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that hard courts can be unforgiving on the joints, especially during prolonged play sessions. To mitigate this issue, players may opt for cushioned court surfaces or use appropriate footwear to minimize the risk of injuries.\n\n‚Äç\n\nCushioned Court Surfaces\n\n‚Äç\n\nCushioned court surfaces, such as those made of acrylic or rubber, offer an excellent compromise between comfort and performance. These surfaces provide a slight cushioning effect, reducing the impact on players' joints while maintaining consistent ball bounce and speed.\n\n‚Äç\n\nCushioned courts are particularly favored by players who prioritize comfort and injury prevention. The added shock absorption helps alleviate stress on the knees and ankles, allowing players to enjoy longer and more comfortable play sessions. Additionally, the slightly slower pace of play on cushioned surfaces can benefit players who rely on precision and control rather than sheer power.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAnother advantage of cushioned court surfaces is their versatility. They can be installed both indoors and outdoors, making them suitable for year-round play in various climates. Whether you're playing in a recreational facility or a backyard court, the cushioned surface provides a comfortable and enjoyable pickleball experience for players of all skill levels.\n\n‚Äç\n\nClay Court Surfaces\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhile pickleball is traditionally played on hard courts or dedicated pickleball courts, it's worth noting that the game can technically be played on clay surfaces as well. However, compared to tennis, where clay courts are widely used in professional tournaments like the French Open, pickleball on clay courts is not as common.\n\n‚Äç\n\nOne of the standout features of clay courts is their ability to slow down the pace of play. The soft surface absorbs more energy from the ball, resulting in a slower ball speed and higher bounce. This characteristic favors players who rely on consistency and strategy rather than power, encouraging longer rallies and strategic shot placement.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAdditionally, clay courts are renowned for their traction and footwork benefits. The fine particles on the surface provide excellent grip, allowing players to make quick direction changes and execute precise movements with confidence. This makes clay courts particularly appealing to players who prioritize agility and maneuverability on the court.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe choice of surface can significantly impact your pickleball experience, affecting everything from ball bounce to player comfort. Whether you prefer the fast-paced action of hard courts, the comfort of cushioned surfaces, or the strategic challenges of clay courts, each surface offers its unique advantages and appeals to different playing styles. Ultimately, the best surface for you is the one that enhances your enjoyment of the game and allows you to play at your best.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLearn more about pickleball tips and tricks on our website.\n\n‚Äç"}

It‚Äôs a fun, social, and accessible sport suitable for people of all ages and skill levels. If you‚Äôre new to pickleball or considering giving it a try, this beginner's guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started, from the basics of how to play to choosing the best pickleball paddles for beginners.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat is Pickleball?\n\nPickleball was invented in 1965 by Congressman Joel Pritchard, Barney McCallum, and BillBell on Bainbridge Island, WA. It started as a simple family activity and had since evolved into one of the fastest-growing sports in the U.S. Its mix of tennis, badminton, and pingpong elements makes it an exciting game for players of all skill levels.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTypically played on a badminton-sized court with a modified tennis net, pickleball uses a solid paddle and a perforated plastic ball. The game can be played in singles or doubles, making it versatile and fun for players with varying preferences.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow to Play Pickleball for Beginners\n\nThe objective of pickleball is simple: score points by hitting the ball over the net and into your opponent's court without letting it bounce twice. The game begins with an underhand serve, which must land diagonally across the court. After the serve, players continue volleying until a point is scored or a fault is committed.\n\nHere‚Äôs a quick breakdown of pickleball rules for beginners to get you started:\n\nThe Kitchen: The non-volley zone (called \"The Kitchen\") restricts players from hitting the ball while standing in it.\nServe Rules: The serve must clear the non-volley zone and land within the opposite diagonal court.\nThe Bounce Rule: The ball must bounce once on each side of the net before players can begin volleying.\nScoring: Points can only be scored by the serving team.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleball Equipment and Attire for Beginners\n\nOne of the things that makes pickleball so accessible is its minimal equipment requirements. All you need to start is a paddle, a ball, and a good pair of court shoes. But finding the best pickleball paddles for beginners is crucial to enhancing your game and comfort.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleball paddles come in various materials, shapes, and sizes. The most common paddle materials include wood, composite, and graphite. Wooden paddles are heavier and more affordable, while composite and graphite paddles tend to be lighter, offer better control, and are preferred by more advanced players. For beginners, a lightweight paddle with a comfortable grip will help you improve your technique and enjoy the game. As for attire, breathable and moisture-wicking clothing is recommended, along with hats and sunglasses for outdoor play.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTracking Your Skill Level and Player Rating\n\nAs you begin to improve your skills, you might be curious about how your performance stacks up against others. In pickleball, the DUPR (Dynamic Universal Pickleball Rating) system is the most accurate and widely adopted pickleball rating system.

They strike without warning, leaving you sidelined and frustrated. But there's good news: you can prevent them with the right approach.\n\nPickleball players face unique challenges inthe summer heat. Long matches, intense rallies, and scorching temperatures create a perfect storm for dehydration and cramping. We'll explore why this happens and how to stop it.\n\nBy the end, you'll have a clear plan to stay hydrated and cramp-free. Let's dive in and keep you on the court all summer long.\n\n‚Äç\n\nUnderstanding the Cramp Culprits\n\nMany players instinctively blame dehydration for their muscle cramps, but the reality is more nuanced. While hydration certainly plays a crucial role, muscle fatigue is an equally important factor often overlooked.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nDehydration can indeed trigger cramps, but simply drinking water isn't always the solution.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nElectrolyte imbalance can cause cramping even if you're well-hydrated, which is why smart replenishment strategies are essential. Moreover, as muscles fatigue during intense play, the nerve signals controlling contractions can become disrupted, leading to involuntary spasms.\n\n‚Äç\n\nResearch has shown that cramp-prone athletes tend to lose more sodium through sweat, making thoughtful hydration particularly crucial for pickleball players battling the summer heat. Studies have also demonstrated that electrolyte-rich sports drinks fortified with carbohydrates are significantly more effective than water alone in delaying the onset of cramps.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nBy addressing both hydration and muscle fatigue, you'll dramatically reduce your risk of cramps. Let's dive into practical steps to keep you playing at your best.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHydration: More Than Just Water\n\nWhile chugging plain water before a match might seem like a smart move, it can sometimes backfire. Excessive water intake without proper electrolyte balance can actually dilute your body's mineral concentrations, potentially increasing your cramp risk.\n\n‚Äç\n\nInstead, focus on a more strategic approach:\n\n‚Äç\n\nConsume a sports drink containing electrolytes 2-4 hours before play to prime your system.\nDuring activity, aim to replace 16-20 ounces of fluid for every pound of body weight lost through sweat.\nConsider using a hydration tracking app or smart water bottle to ensure you're hitting your targets.\n\n‚Äç\n\nGrab the Ultimate Pickleball Hydration guide for more information on pre-, during, and post-match hydration. It includes a special formula for determining exactly how much fluid you need to consume every 15-20 minutes to stay in peak form on the court.\n\n‚Äç\n\n[I WANT THE HYDRATION GUIDE]\n\n‚Äç\n\nProper hydration not only prevents cramps but also enhances overall performance and speeds up recovery between games. By fine-tuning your hydration strategy, you'll gain a significant advantage on the court.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nHowever, hydration is just one piece of the puzzle ‚Äì let's explore another crucial factor in cramp prevention.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFueling for Success\n\nThe role of nutrition in preventing muscle cramps is often underestimated, but it's a critical component, especially during grueling tournament play. Proper fueling keeps your muscles energized and less prone to fatigue-induced cramping.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTo optimize your nutritional strategy:\n\n‚Äç\n\nConsume a balanced meal rich in complex carbohydrates 3-4 hours before play to build up your energy reserves.\nDuring tournaments, snack on easily digestible carbs every 60-90 minutes to maintain steady energy levels.\nConsider using carb-electrolyte gels between games for a quick boost when time is limited.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThese tactics help keep your glycogen stores topped up, delaying the onset of muscle fatigue that can lead to cramping. While pickleball may not be as intense as ultra-endurance sports, the principle of consistent fueling still applies. Research on team sport athletes suggests consuming 30 - 60g of carbs per hour during prolonged activity ‚Äì adapt this to your specific needs and playing duration.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nBy fueling smartly, you're helping your muscles function optimally and resist fatigue. This translates directly to fewer cramps and improved performance, especially in those crucial late-game moments. But there's one more vital element we need to address to complete your cramp-prevention arsenal.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTraining for Resilience\n\nYour overall fitness level plays a significant role in how susceptible you are to cramping. The less conditioned you are, the faster fatigue sets in, increasing your risk of muscle spasms. This is especially true when you push beyond your usual intensity or duration of play.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTo build cramp-resistant muscles:\n\n‚Äç\n\nGradually increase your pickleball training volume and intensity over time to improve your stamina.\nIncorporate resistance training into your overall fitness routine to improve strength, power, and stamina on the court.\nDon't neglect overall cardiovascular fitness ‚Äì it's the foundation of your on-court endurance.\n\n‚Äç\n\nA well-rounded training program complements your hydration and nutrition efforts, creating a powerful trifecta of cramp prevention. Together, these strategies form a comprehensive approach to keeping you on the court and off the sidelines.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nPreventing muscle cramps requires a holistic approach that addresses hydration, nutrition, and fitness. By implementing the strategies we've discussed, you'll significantly reduce your risk of cramping and elevate your game, even in the most challenging summer conditions.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAuthors\n\nPratik Patel\n\nErik Korem, PhD\n\n‚Äç"}

Learn how DUPR helps shape the next generation of players.", "url": "https://www.dupr.com/post/reliability-score--a-deep-dive-with-head-of-dupr-analytics-scott-mendelssohn", "content": "Improving the DUPR algorithm is an ongoing process that spans honing the statistical methods that underpin the research, fine-tuning the look-and-feel of the product, and increasing the number and value of the applications and integrations within the community. Some iterations, like the Win Intensity model we released earlier this year or the instantaneous algo release of last year touch on one or maybe two of those categories modularly. It‚Äôs a particularly fun project when all three pillars of the DUPR ecosystem are involved; DUPR‚Äôs Reliability Score has the distinct honor of spanning all three.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor those of you who missed the release or are perhaps still curious about what this random new circle is that appeared beside your rating lately, there‚Äôs a great FAQ that the team put together which walks you through the basics of what the score is at a high level and how to interact with it, understand it, and progress through your own path to ratings reliability. For many folks, that‚Äôll give you everything you need to know, but for those of you who read my last blog posts put out when the new dynamic algorithm was released in January and like to go behind the scenes: this one‚Äôs for you.\n\nModel Inspiration\n\nIn the theme of assured and steady incremental progress, we took a look at each component of the rating algorithm and decided on a research path forward. One such component was the halflife that we had inherited from previous versions of DUPR. The name ‚Äúhalflife‚Äù borrowed from a concept in physics (amongst other fields) describing the rate of things like radioactive decay in unstable atoms. The physics term is a parameter that specifically denotes the typical time it takes for something to decay in half and that concept was applied in the decay of that original reliability metric over time. Then, the metric itself eventually just began to use the name of its parameter in common parlance.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAs it stood, the halflife was measuring the frequency and recency of your play on DUPR: matches played today counted for 1 ‚Äúhalflife‚Äù each and matches played 3 months ago counted for approximately ¬Ω ‚Äúhalflife‚Äù each; the halflife shown on your profile was the sum of these values. Higher values of halflife were then seen as more stable player ratings because there was more information in those ratings, but there wasn‚Äôt a clean line to be drawn from the halflife number we provided to how to understand it in practice and users were left trying to establish good rules of thumb as filters for things like clubs, leagues, or tournaments.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe components of halflife weren‚Äôt wrong, by many means. Frequent play pretty clearly represents this concept of ratings reliability‚Äìthe more you play, the more data we have and the more we can average out the inherent noise within pickleball data. Recent play is also clearly important‚Äìif you played 10 matches 10 years ago, can we really expect your current form to be well captured by those results? But the halflife was a simple approximation of what we were really trying to capture, namely, ‚Äúis this number well informed‚Äù and the elements motivating progress and bringing users back to the platform were indirect at best.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThere are so many other features besides frequency and recency that go into how information spreads through the pickleball network. And even something as simple as play frequency has its nuances. For instance, playing with the same partner against the same two opponents five million times over and over again and never once playing with anybody else does not make for a particularly informed rating. The algo would absolutely learn the relative rating between the two teams, but learning the level of play of each of the members of the team relative to one another would be impossible with the granularity of the data we have access to‚Äìwe wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell by simply looking at the scores which of the teammates contributed more to the winning percentage. And even if we did have a good understanding of the players relative to one another, we would have no way to numerically compare them to the rest of the population because they‚Äôve only ever played amongst themselves.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhile never quite as drastic as this, the network of pickleball matches has plenty of pockets of hyper-localized information in this general theme, most notably amongst clusters of geography, age, and gender, where the community currently builds up these insular networks. A universal rating can and should be accounting for this both in how the rating algo learns but also in how we express the informational content, or reliability, of its result.\n\n‚Äç\n\nOur research project was clear. How can we extend the concept of the halflife to:\n\nMore accurately and precisely measure the intended statistical concept\nBe built in such a way that we can later integrate it cleanly it into the rating itself\nProvide a clear format to the community for engaging with it and using it to improve the DUPR experience\n\n‚Äç\n\nMore Accurate and Precise\n\nStarting from specifically trying to measure the flow and collection of information in the DUPR network led us to re-envision the rating as a large graph of connections rather than as a series of isolated interactions. The context of a match matters significantly as well as the context of each of the participants in said match; e.g. competing in tournaments with many other reliable players allows your rating to soak up a lot of the information present in each of your matches, and playing across multiple clusters of subpopulations gives your rating the opportunity to meld into the universal rating level that DUPR tracks across the globe. So we took the network of every match ever entered on DUPR and enriched it with measurements of the information flow we‚Äôd expect from that match based on all of the metadata available to us. Was this with a new partner? Rec play or a tournament? Did you play with some DUPR newbies or was it with some seasoned veterans? Was the match against an evenly-matched opponent or did this look like a blowout from the get go? All of these things and more compile into just how statistically informational this match was in the journey for a reliable rating.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe result is a way for the algorithm to visualize the web of relationships we model and in a complex, multifaceted way, far surpassing the quality of the simplistic halflife measure before. Every match you play now, regardless of partner, opponent, match type, etc., has its informational value measured and added to your Reliability Score which will accumulate as you play more and begin to fade over time if you aren‚Äôt adding many matches on the app.\n\n‚Äç\n\nRatings Integration\n\nWhile not yet integrated into your rating itself (like any sustainable research project, we wanted to roll this out first and make sure it was ironed out completely before affecting your rating), the goal is to have the reliability score go hand in hand with the way the rating moves over time. More reliable ratings should have less movement, less reliable ratings should have more movement. Playing in a match that provides a lot of information to your rating (entering a tournament for the first time or joining a league) should move your rating relatively more vs. one that is less informative (perhaps some pickup games with a close group of friends you play with all the time). When you take a break from your league play to take lessons and come back and dominate next season, the algorithm should respond to that appropriately. When you venture into new territory and play a match in which you learn something about yourself, DUPR should as well. The intuition around your own experience should be well mirrored by the algorithm. Stay tuned for more here as the research continues, but DUPR‚Äôs Reliability Score was designed intentionally to be able to make a significant impact on the intuition and feel of the DUPR rating algorithm itself.\n\n‚Äç\n\nCommunity Engagement\n\nThe raw output of the reliability algorithm is basically unintelligible to most things that aren‚Äôt a computer, so a crucial step beyond just getting the analysis right was being able to convert that analysis into a format that the community could use. We determined that the most sensible format here (in part to avoid confusion with the ranking itself) was to provide a Reliability Score as a 0-100% range. In order to map something inane like 0.000947392 to a Reliability Score Meant for Humans, we had to figure out a transformation that provided us with key milestones. For instance, 60% is where we marked a ‚Äúpassing grade‚Äù, but the actual number of 60% is somewhat arbitrary. The important part is what we‚Äôre calling ‚Äú60%‚Äù actually represents.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTo determine what constitutes a passing grade, we looked at the entire universe of DUPR players and matches and performed a stability analysis, looking for key elements that correlated to having accurate predictions and stable rating. Identifying a threshold of stability across these features, we were able to model the raw reliability number that strongly predicted whether a rating was going to be steady and accurate for most of the population. Rarely does a model predict something perfectly, and the Reliability Score is no different. Leagues, clubs, and tournaments should continue to use DUPR‚Äôs Reliability Score as a strong indicator of the reliability of the DUPR rating, but we continue to urge organizers to look holistically at the players and profiles and make their own evaluations. The Reliability Score is meant to help enrich the ways the pickleball community can come together to get fair, level-based play and shouldn‚Äôt be used to blindly limit or restrict.\n\nWe‚Äôre excited about what the Reliability Score can bring to the pickleball community and look forward to continuing to research and advance our product to bring as much to this fantastic community of players, coaches, organizers, and fans!\n\n‚Äç\n\nThanks for reading, and talk to you next time!\n\n‚Äç"}

Among its most enthusiastic players are the young athletes who represent the future of this dynamic sport. The National Junior Pickleball (NJP) organization is at the forefront of this youth movement, providing an unparalleled platform for junior players to compete, learn, and grow. With events like those held across the nation, NJP is transforming the landscape of youth pickleball and creating unforgettable experiences for young athletes and their families.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe NJP Experience\n\nThe excitement and friendship of NJP tournaments are palpable from the moment the kids step onto the courts. Maverick, a 12-year-old player, encapsulates the spirit of these events perfectly:\n\n‚ÄúNJP is the absolute BEST tournament for Juniors. In both Arizona and Missouri, there was nonstop pickle play, great kids, and fun times on and off the court.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nHe reflects on the vibrant and inclusive atmosphere that NJP strives to foster, where every match is an opportunity not just for competition, but for making lasting memories and friendships.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAriana A, aged 13, also shared her enthusiasm about her NJP experience:\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúMy first NJP experience was simply amazing! Everyone involved in the organization of this event was kind, welcoming, and extremely supportive. They did a fantastic job of running a fair and smooth tournament. I got to compete and become friends with exceptionally talented kids from around the country. Overall, it was a fun and pleasant experience and I can‚Äôt wait to participate in the next National Junior Pickleball event!!‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nFrom ensuring fair play to creating a supportive environment, NJP's commitment to excellence is evident in every aspect of their events.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR‚Äôs Role at NJP\n\nCourtney Loughridge, founder of¬† NJP, agrees that the common story among parents of players is that there is a lack of recreational games for kids.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúParents say that their kid only plays rec with adults, don‚Äôt have any kids to play with and they don‚Äôt want to play against adults in tournaments. We don‚Äôt know where they fit in or what their true skill level is.‚Äù Courtney says.\n\n‚Äç\n\nNJP has continuously supported the growth of pickleball by utilizing the DUPR platform at the start of every junior's pickleball journey.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúOn the first evening of the event, NJP evaluators watch during skills clinic and king of the court style open play to ensure players are in the correct general skill bucket of beginner, intermediate, and advanced, as well as age groups of 12U, 14U, and 18U‚Äù, Courtney states.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR has been a way for the Juniors to play competitive games within their age and skill in singles, doubles, and team events with players from all around the country.\n\n‚Äç\n\nShe adds ‚Äúall of these matches are reported to DUPR, so they have an accurate skill rating by the end of the event‚Äù.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe use of DUPR at NJP tournaments has led Juniors to easily find level-based clinics, leagues, and tournaments regardless of age in tournaments outside of the league as well.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúOnce Juniors have a DUPR, they can more easily know where they should register and can use their DUPR to track their pickleball journey as they grow and develop‚Äù, Courtney says.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe NJP Championships in October will be seeded accordingly using DUPR ratings, to help ensure that brackets are fair and balanced throughout the field.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nA Community of Support\n\nOne of the standout features of NJP is the strong sense of community it builds among participants and their families. Tina L, mother of 10-year-old Madison, expresses her gratitude for the organization‚Äôs family-friendly approach:\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúAs a parent, I‚Äôm thrilled that NJP is geared to benefit the kids!! They have so much fun and play so many games! Kids and parents building new friendships! It reminded us of our travel soccer club days!‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe round-robin play format ensures a fair and competitive experience, as brackets are organized by similar skill levels and age groups, allowing participants to compete against peers of comparable ability. Beyond the excitement on the courts, players can enjoy a variety of perks, including free swag. The top three winners in each age and skill division will be honored with medals and a podium ceremony, celebrating their achievements in style. Additionally, the event provides opportunities to connect off the courts, fostering lasting memories and networking with potential partners and sponsors, enhancing the overall experience for all attendees. NJP events are also designed to allow players to meet and get to know each other before committing to a team. Players can sign up for the tournament with or without a doubles partner or team.\n\n‚Äç\n\nEmpowering the Next Generation\n\nThe mission of NJP goes beyond organizing tournaments; it is about empowering young athletes and helping them reach their full potential. By providing a structured yet enjoyable environment, NJP helps players develop their skills, gain confidence, and learn important life lessons through sport. The organization‚Äôs dedication to youth development is evident in every aspect of its operations, from the high-quality facilities to the professional and supportive staff.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs NJP continues to grow and expand, the future looks incredibly bright for young pickleball players across the country! With each tournament, NJP not only showcases the talent of junior athletes but also strengthens the pickleball community, one match at a time.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor more information about upcoming events and how to get involved, visit the National Junior Pickleball website. Whether you‚Äôre a young player eager to compete, a parent looking to support your child‚Äôs passion, or a pickleball enthusiast wanting to witness the future of the sport, NJP offers something truly special.

Explore the world‚Äôs only global pickleball ratings system for players worldwide.", "url": "https://www.dupr.com/post/how-to-get-started-with-organizing-game-play-successfully", "content": "Devan Egan, the founder of Club Pickleball USA, brings extensive experience and a deep passion for the sport. Having made all the mistakes himself, he now shares valuable tips to help you avoid them. Read on to learn how he started his club, how he keeps it on track, and how you can get your club moving too!\n\nWhen Club Pickleball USA first started, The initial assumption about what pickleball players wanted was quite narrow. Most players would interact with the sport the same way. It was shocking how quite the opposite it is.\n\nAfter years of playing and running an extensive programming experience for thousands of pickleballers, Devan has identified 4 key principles for organized play. Let‚Äôs dive into each one:\n\nHelp Players Find Each Other\nCreate the Right Schedule\nTreat Open Play Differently¬†\nMarket Your Club\n\n‚Äç\n\nHelp Players Find Each Other\n\nThe first thing to understand with organized game play is to realize that most players have nobody to play with. The purpose of organized play is to bring people together by skill level, age, gender, or interests (casual play, competitive play, social experiences, etc.).\n\nMany people are mistaken here‚Äînot everyone wants to reserve a court. A lot of people prefer the simplicity of signing up for an event individually, showing up, and having a predictable, quality experience with lots of other players.¬†\n\nSome events (open play, socials) help players meet each other, but you also need to create a culture of connection. One helpful secret for Devan has been using GroupMe. With GroupMe, he organizes the groups by skill level, and the players become some of the best marketers to help fill events while also creating player connections for private court reservations.¬†\n\nPickleball brings people together and sometimes your players just need a little guidance and help to make the quality connections they‚Äôre looking for.\n\n¬†\n\nCreate the Right Schedule\n\nA lot of clubs focus on what they do, but far too many forget about the importance of when to do it. The right timing and schedule can make all the difference in whether or not an event fills up.\n\nThe most effective strategy has been to schedule events that align with specific groups we observe visiting at those specific times. If most of your court reservations with a specific group are from 10 am to noon, it‚Äôs likely that others in their same group type (for instance, age range) would join an event at that same time. Let the players give those signals out; be observant and responsive to those player habits and pay attention to the audience. Don‚Äôt let the players dictate the entire schedule, but there are a lot of opportunities and events that are born out of their suggestions.\n\nOne of the key practices that Devan and Club Pickleball USA adheres to is maintaining a balanced schedule of offerings at various times. Create a calendar sheet (separate from your regular court management software) that outlines your event offerings by day and time of the week, specifying the intended audience (such as skill level, age group, etc.). This will help identify the gaps and opportunities within the programming schedule for new or additional events.¬†\n\nAdditionally, it‚Äôs ideal to maintain 2 to 4-hour gaps between similar or larger-scale events to provide two reservation windows in the calendar. For instance, a 3-hour gap between a large morning event and a large midday event minimizes the ability to fill the courts only during those events. Most groups like to play for 2 hours ‚Äì so now an hour of opportunity (in most cases) is thrown away because it failed to gap the experiences sufficiently. A 4-hour gap would have allowed for 2 different groups to make a 2-hour reservation in between the 2 large events.\n\nLastly, don‚Äôt give all of your courts to one experience. Set aside at least 3 or 4 courts for private reservations; otherwise, players will feel excluded or limited from equal access to court time, particularly in peak hours. Within reason, we will wait until we‚Äôre within 48 hours before adding people from a waitlist for an event to take most or all of the courts.\n\n¬†\n\nTreat Open Play Differently¬†\n\nIf there's one key takeaway from this article, it's this topic. This is where most clubs go wrong with their programming schedules. Let's break down the DOs and DON'Ts:\n\nDO (Be sure to read and use the don‚Äôt section in conjunction with the do‚Äôs.):\n\nOffer an extensive and frequent open play schedule (three 3-hour sessions per day). Ideally one in the morning, one midday, and one evening.\nBook the event for 2.5 or 3 hours, 2 hours is not enough time for a rotational experience.\nUtilize challenge courts to give higher-skilled players an outlet.\nUse wristbands at check-in to verify players who registered are actually the ones playing. You may have other members who didn‚Äôt register bleed over from their expired court reservation and throw off your numbers. ‚ÄúWrist band check!‚Äù is how to catch the rule abusers.\nPost signs about paddle-up rules and gameplay.\nDepending on the number of players, have an ambassador/employee helping direct traffic and monitor for abuse.\n\nDON‚ÄôT:¬†\n\nDon't assign skill levels to courts or open-play events. This approach can undermine your skill-specific events and force you to choose who to accommodate if all skill levels are waitlisted and you only have one court left to offer.\nDon‚Äôt allow players to use more than 1 paddle in the paddle rack.\nDon‚Äôt allow more than 8 players per court. We like the 7-7.5 player-to-court ratio.\nDon‚Äôt use prime court hours for open play. Instead, use open play as a filler for the second and third-tier court hours.\n\n¬†\n\nMarket Your Club\n\nThis is what sets Club Pickleball USA apart from its competitors: a deep understanding of marketing and sales principles. This includes knowing how to create effective funnels, both online and in-person, for both prospects and existing players. It's essential to allocate a marketing budget to attract new players to the club.\n\nTheir marketing efforts are always focused on 3 primary initiatives:\n\nGrowth! Always be adding players to your database; this creates opportunities for new members and keeps your club busy.\nRepeat Business. The most probable customer is someone who has already engaged with the club. Utilize retargeting ads to remind your audience of the club's offerings, including the training academy, events, tournaments, memberships, and more.\nIncrease Revenue. Invest marketing dollars in experiences that yield a return. Avoid \"branding campaigns\" until the club has been established for several years with a loyal audience. Instead, focus marketing efforts on achieving a positive return on ad spend (ROAS) that can be meticulously tracked. Monitor every penny spent and measure the resulting revenue. Allocate funds to experiences that offer a higher margin per court hour, such as tournaments and corporate events.\n\nAs the club evolves, strategies and implementations can become more refined and targeted. In the early stages, prioritize enhancing the player experience and ensure its delivery. When a 5-star experience is consistently provided, most other challenges tend to resolve themselves. Achieving this top-tier experience involves connecting players, offering flexible scheduling options, being strategic yet generous with open-play opportunities, and leveraging social media marketing to enhance efforts.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBy integrating these best practices from Club Pickleball USA‚Äôs Devan Egan, clubs can cultivate a winning culture among players and see positive impacts on both player satisfaction and financial success!

But could that rivalry turn into companionship as the racquet sports family becomes ever more diverse?¬†That was the main takeaway from the inaugural RacquetX festival at Miami Beach Convention Center in March, which brought pickleball, tennis, padel, POP tennis and other racquet/paddle swinging cousins together to learn from each other, network, and find common ground. '\n\n‚Äç\n\nA rising tide lifts all ships,' as the saying goes. Or, as one speaker at RacquetX cleverly put it, 'It's time to love all!'¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄçResearch by RacquetX revealed the emergence of a 'cross-court consumer' with 43% of responders playing more than one racquet sport in the last year or intending to diversify their play. The research also noted tremendous growth potential in public courts and clubs opening up access for all market segments (pickleball, tennis, padel, etc.).¬†Venues are already adapting to this more diverse consumer demand. Life Time Fitness has introduced pickleball at many of its 200+ locations across the US. Life Time Tempe in Phoenix, AZ, has converted three outdoor tennis courts into 12 pickleball courts and an additional three indoors, replacing a basketball court. They host the bi-annual Life Time Tempe Fall Classic, regional tournaments, events for two local universities and a junior program.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nNorma Sedillo, Tennis and Pickleball Coordinator at Life Time Tempe, said,\n\n\"Pickleball was not initially embraced by the tennis community here. It was seen as the ugly duckling. But things changed. I'd say 50% of my tennis players are now playing pickleball - but they are not abandoning tennis. They are playing both.‚Äù¬†\"They still have their strong ties within tennis but those communities are transitioning into pickleball. Once they start moving, they move in waves - the friendships remain but they are spending time together on both types of court.\"¬†\n\nLife Time's venue in Westchester, NY, has pickleball, tennis, and squash courts over 2,000 sq ft, whereas Life Time Sky in Manhattan (with two pickleball courts) has to be more selective with its use of space. Sky's Lead Pickleball Pro, Andy Peeke, hasn't witnessed a huge amount of cross-pollination between racquet sports.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"There's an incredible demand for pickleball so we have to follow that demand in deciding what to do with the space we have,\" he says. \"If your four tennis courts aren't at capacity and there is demand for pickleball, clubs notice pretty quickly they can fit in 16 pickleball courts and not only quadruple their profits, but quadruple community satisfaction.\"\nAndy Peeke and Emily Visnic at Life Time Sky\n\n‚Äç\n\n¬†He describes Life Time Sky as \"possibly the most DUPR-heavy club in the country:\n\n\"Here, your DUPR rating is your passport. If you're a 4.49 you're not entering a 4.5, otherwise we'd end up with a public park type of system. We're getting super competitive, but most of all, people love being part of our community.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nOn the first weekend in May 2024, Life Time Penn 1 opened its new pickleball courts with exhibitions by Andre Agassi, Kim Clijsters, Tyson McGuffin and Life Time founder, chairman and CEO Bahram Akradi.Across the Atlantic, Imber Court Sports Club in southwest London (built on land formerly owned by King Henry VIII) has two pickleball courts, four padel courts and 15 tennis courts (four of those tennis courts will soon be converted into six padel and four pickleball courts).¬†Clinton Lamprecht, founder of England Sports Group which coordinates all sports activities at the club, says he doesn't recognize the emergence of the so-called cross-court consumer.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"We haven't seen cross-pollination,\" he states. \"People here tend to find their tribe and stick with it. We've probably only got half a dozen members who will actively play pickleball and padel. I'm curious to see whether we'll see more of that over the years.\"¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nAlthough Clinton believes tennis will suffer in the short term as pickleball and padel grow, he does believe in the 'rising tide lifts all ships' theory.\n\n\"The new sports are going to lower participation levels in tennis, there's no doubt about that. But it's also going to create opportunities for everyone in the racquet sports sector to increase participation overall between those three different racquet sports.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\n¬†While demand from individuals to play multiple racquet sports doesn't appear to be universal yet, clubs are recognizing the need to diversify their offering of court types and appeal to all sectors. In time, this may lead to the racquet sports co-existing more happily and appreciating the potential of learning and thriving together."}

Rachael is known for her dynamic playing style and strategic abilities on the court. Having played tennis for over twenty years, Rachael competed semi-professionally and collegiately for the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill before transitioning to pickleball. Rachael now plays pickleball professionally on a full-time basis, regularly facing off against the best players in the world. She also spends her time teaching the sport to others while balancing her busy tournament schedule. Follow along and get to know Rachael a little bit more in this Q&A!\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow did you find pickleball and how has it changed your life?\n\nI wanted to find an activity where I could bond with my mom and make new friends. We had our first pickleball lesson together at the Delray Tennis Center, and I instantly fell in love with the sport. Now, I have an amazing community of friends, a stronger bond with my mom, and a new profession!\n\n\n\nWhat is your favorite memory from your career so far?\n\nI have so many great memories, it‚Äôs hard to choose just one! However, one that stands out is beating DJ Young and Cass Hoag 2-3 months ago. That match was a turning point in my career and marked significant growth in my pickleball development. I train hard every day to improve, and it was gratifying to see my efforts pay off. Since then, I've had several big wins, making that match a major milestone in my career.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat motivates you to become a pro pickleball player?\n\nBeing a professional pickleball player is what I want to do with my life. As long as I avoid any career-ending injuries, I plan to keep playing until the end‚ÄîI'll probably die on the court.\n\n‚Äç\n\nRachael competing at a PPA\n\nWhat athlete or person inspires you the most?\n\nMy parents are my greatest inspiration. Originally from the east side of Detroit, Michigan, my family moved to Florida when I was younger to provide me with the best opportunities in tennis and a better future. They sacrificed a lot and continue to demonstrate incredible strength and perseverance.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat does your current training regimen look like?\n\nNow that my mixed doubles game has improved significantly, I'm focusing on getting my singles game back to its previous level. Starting today, I plan to train 1.5 hours in singles and 1.5 hours in doubles, Monday through Friday. Previously, I trained exclusively in doubles for 3-4 hours each day during the week.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat is your greatest accomplishment in sports?\n\nMy latest greatest accomplishment in sports is having the bravery to pursue a new sport full-time besides tennis and fully committing to it. The date I was able to be a full-time pickleball player was August 1st, 2023.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat part of your game are you working on the most right now?\n\nMy focus is on singles and playing the left side in gendered doubles. Many women excel on the right side due to mixed doubles experience. By mastering the left side, I can partner with almost anyone. That will give me the best opportunity to make big runs in tournaments.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat do you do outside of pickleball?\n\n\"I really love the beach, painting, and walking around expensive neighborhoods, lol. \"\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow havelevel-basedd tournaments help you improve your pickleball skills?\n\n¬†\"I only played one 5.0 PPA tournament and I won it. After that, I went and played only in the pro division.\"\n\n\n‚Äç\n\nRachael has also started a business called Pickle Pros, where we create personalized webpages for athletes that showcase their accomplishments and allow people to book lessons with them around their travel and tournament schedules. She adds,\n\n\"Our platform is designed to support aspiring pro pickleball players by providing them with a way to earn money while at home, while also enabling them to travel and compete in tournaments.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nCheck out Rachael's pickleball journey and more on her Instagram and website!\n\n‚Äç"}

However, UVA got the last laugh in that matchup as they beat Utah Tech 3-1, and then proceeded to win the whole tournament.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWatch this epic final here!\n\nAveree Beck and Kamryn Bliss\n\nHungry for more Collegiate Pickleball?

He recalled telling his wife that he wanted to end his life. ‚ÄúAnd after all the years of doing that to her,‚Äù he recalls, ‚Äúshe cried.‚Äù At that moment, Happy chose sobriety.¬†\n\nPickleball came into his life shortly after.¬†¬†\n\n\"The first time I hit the ball,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúI had flashbacks to playing goalie.

When we were 8 years old, we would get those balls and I would just throw them against the wall and try to stop them. Well, that's where being a goalie came from. I loved stopping the puck.

The program, available on My Pickleball Coach, seamlessly integrates cameras, the DUPR app, and the My Pickleball Coach app, enabling coaches to initiate scalable coaching experiences for thousands of players, generate DUPR ratings, and foster new revenue streams and expansion for coaches and clubs.\n\n‚Äç\n\nTito Machado, CEO of DUPR remarked, ‚ÄúWe developed the Global Skills Program in partnership with My Pickleball Coach to offer coaches scalable technology to support their efforts to grow and develop the game in their communities. When players are rated on DUPR and have opportunities to develop their skills, everyone in the global pickleball ecosystem benefits, from facilities, clubs, equipment manufacturers, travel companies and everyone who touches the game.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nJordan Briones, one of the leading pickleball coaches with over 65,000 subscribers on YouTube, emphasized, ‚ÄúWith 13 million active players and another 17 million beginners joining the game, the key to sustaining pickleball's growth lies in growing and measuring skills for players. By becoming a DUPR Coach, the Global Skills Program equips coaches like me with a simple way to help players get a DUPR, reach their potential and establish a love for the game. When players have a rating and goals to achieve, players play more, join clubs, influence their friends and family to play and contribute to the growth of the sport.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúThe Global Skills Program supports coaches in driving more pickleball activity in their communities by offering a seamless technology solution to initiate DUPR ratings for players and pathways to improve their skills,‚Äù remarked Katie Nimitz, President of MyJourney. ‚ÄúPlayers simply play a game of pickleball where a phone camera or installed camera at the facility records their play. Coaches then use My Pickleball Coach to rapidly evaluate and assess a series of on-paddle and off-paddle skills to personally score key game areas such as technical skills, shot selection, partner chemistry, and court positioning. This automatically then creates the provisional rating and DUPR account for the player with their detailed assessment and DUPR skills rating.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Global Skills Program offers two main components: The DUPR Coach for coaches and the DUPR Skills Subscription for players. The DUPR Coach enables coaches to initiate DUPR ratings for new pickleball players with a skill-based assessment technology. Once trained, coaches can view videos of players and produce provisional DUPRs for players. The DUPR Skills Subscription enables players to receive coaching via the My Pickleball Coach app to improve their DUPR rating. Players can set a level-based goal, i.e. moving from a 3.5 DUPR to a 4.0 DUPR, and access DUPR-specific coaching from Martina Kochli, John Cincola, Jordan Briones, Zane Navratil and Collin Johns, among other DUPR Coaches, via the My Pickleball Coach App.\n\n‚Äç\n\nCoaches interested in becoming a DUPR Coach can click here.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nPlayers looking to improve their DUPR skills can activate the DUPR Skills Subscription by downloading the My Pickleball Coach app here.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAbout My Pickleball Coach¬†\n\nMy Pickleball Coach was developed by the world's top players and coaches like CEO Martina Kochli, John Cincola, Zane Navratil, Jordan Briones and Collin Johns to create a highly scalable way for coaches to grow the sport of pickleball.

I was a high performance tennis player for over a decade, and pickleball is sort of a continuation of that intense mindset but also so exciting because it's a completely new sport.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat is your favorite memory from your professional career so far?\nCompeting on center court multiple times against some of the best, established pro players on tour. I love playing for a crowd, so it's super fun when I get that opportunity.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat motivates you to become a pro pickleball player so far from home?\nBeing able to represent my hometown of New Orleans and also my current location of the D.C./Virginia area means a lot to me. I have thoroughly enjoyed all the people I've met through pickleball and all their support ‚Äì it's what keeps me going and inspires me to pursue more.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat athlete or person inspires you the most?\nNick Kyrgios is my favorite athlete because he doesn't take himself too seriously. At times I find myself stressing out on the court and this year, I've made it my goal to play a little more freely like Nick and really enjoy the moment because that's what it's all about.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat does your current training regimen look like?\nDrill 4-6 days a week, lift 3-4 days a week, rest one day.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat is your greatest accomplishment in sports?\nBecoming a 2x All-American in tennis and leading my team to our first NCAA Elite 8 appearance in 10 years.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat part of your game are you working on the most right now?\nDoubles!\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat do you do outside of pickleball?\nMy favorite thing to do is travel, but D.C. also has no shortage of things to do. I love going to the monuments and museums or trying out local restaurants. I'm a huge foodie and love to cook, so no matter where I am, eating with friends is one of my favorite activities.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor now, some of Taylor's best results are semifinals (4th place) at PPA Daytona and 5th in Beer City Open.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFollow Taylor's Pickleball journey on Instagram!"}

These players can now combine their new favorite hobby with another activity beloved by retirees - cruises.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAs well as hitting the demographics bullseye, pickleball is an attractive proposition for the cruise industry because of the low price of installing courts and their compact 20mx44ft dimensions, far easier to accommodate compared to those of tennis, squash or padel.\n\n¬†\n\nMany cruise ships already contain pickleball courts either indoor or on deck, but Pickleball International is taking its offering several stages further. The company was founded by former professional basketball player Eric Dailey Sr, who is now applying his 15 years' experience in basketball training, competitions and tours to the sport he fell in love with almost as soon as he picked up a paddle.\n\n¬†\n\nHis sports travel enterprise included a partnership with cruise industry giants Caribbean International, which he is now expanding. Pickleball International offer cruises which include pickleball tuition from top pros, competitions and off-court physical preparation including yoga, spin classes, strength and agility training in top-of-the-range gyms and aqua training in the ship's swimming pools - in addition to all the usual cruise attractions: dinners, parties, casino nights and much more.¬†\n\n¬†\n\nAmaWaterWays Co-Founder\n\n‚Äç\n\nEric says: \"The training is an important part of the offer for this demographic of pickleball players. We can't play like we're 17 any more! We have a world-class yoga instructor and facilities to prepare our players' muscles for four hours of fun on court each day.\"\n\n¬†\n\nCaribbean International's ship, The Odyssey of the Seas, has three indoor pickleball courts. Five-day cruises set sail from the UK, Greece and the USA (Fort Lauderdale, Florida) to the Caribbean, Australia, Hong Kong and Alaska. A maximum of 24 players go on a single trip and all standards are catered for by Pickleball International's roster of highly qualified pro coaches ('Z' Orano, Pedro Penteado, Jay Jaudon and Fiona Edwards).\n\n¬†\n\n\"These cruises are for guys who want to improve,\" says Eric. \"If you're a DUPR 3.0, that's fine, go have fun and learn. If you're a 5.0, there will be plenty of competitions to get your teeth into. It's a great opportunity for anyone who loves pickleball and loves to travel.\"\n\n¬†\n\nUK-based Amadeus River Cruises have pickleball courts on their Amadeus Cara and Amadeus Silver III and offer pickleball-themed cruises on which you can take on locals at clubs along the way.\n\n¬†\n\nJanine and Damian on board\n\n‚Äç\n\nAmaWaterways, headquartered in Calabasas, California, has also spotted pickleball's potential. Last year, they added a full-size pickleball court on the 21m-wide deck of the AmaMagna riverboat which cruises along the Danube through Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Serbia, Romania, Slovakia and Turkey.\n\n¬†\n\nPickleball activity led by on-board coach Damian fuses perfectly with the ship's large gym and Zen Wellness Studio (offering circuit training, resistance bands and core training, yoga and Pilates). ‚ÄúMore people want to stay active when they‚Äôre on holiday. Pickleball is really easy to pick up and you can quickly start playing a game,‚Äù says Damian.\n\n¬†\n\nAs more cruise companies capitalize on pickleball's popularity, we are sure to see the trend for dinking on deck spread across the globe."}

A singles-based tiebreaker format, called a dreambreaker, is used when teams are tied 2-2.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Dink Minor League Pickleball‚Äôs National Pathway allows teams to compete locally to pursue a spot at the national championship. A national leaderboard is utilized to display ranked players, allowing you to easily view their standings.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIts first official season was in 2023, and its director, Caroline Luelf, is tasked with growing the organization.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLuelf's journey with the league began as a participant, along with her husband, in a one-day event in Kansas City. The convenience of these short events appealed to the couple, balancing their passion for pickleball with family commitments.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nAs Luelf says, ‚ÄúWhen you have four kids, planning the logistics, getting all the kids to where they need to be and us being gone three or four days for a tournament, that's not easy.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nAfter participating in several Minor League Pickleball events and experiencing firsthand the thrill of competition and community, Luelf was inspired to bring the experience to her hometown in Oklahoma. Her first event sold out and received rave reviews. Luelf shares, ‚ÄúThis one team posted on Facebook that it was their favorite tournament ever. They didn't even win a match!‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nPeople were hungry for more events, and Luelf decided to reach out directly to the league saying, ‚ÄúI love everything about Minor League Pickleball, and I have all these ideas on how to grow it.‚Äù A few weeks later, they offered her a job.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat sets the league apart is its emphasis on the team concept.\n\n‚Äç\nUnlike traditional tournaments, where players compete individually, The Dink Minor League Pickleball encourages collaboration and support among teammates. With rally scoring and opportunities for coaching between points, players are fully engaged both on and off the court, creating an electrifying atmosphere for participants and spectators alike.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n\"The Dink Minor League Pickleball is for everyone,‚Äù Luelf notes. It‚Äôs for any player ‚Äî from amateurs to non-contracted pros, regardless of age. Events have seen players as young as 12 and as old as 70. The family-friendly nature is obvious, with Caroline herself cherishing the opportunity to play alongside her husband and 18-year-old son and create lasting memories on the court.\n\n‚Äç\n\nLooking ahead, The Dink MiLP's goal is ‚Äúto be in all 50 states‚Äù (they are currently in 29 states) and ‚Äúcontinue to expand globally,‚Äù according to Luelf. With events planned across the United States, Canada, Australia, Mexico, Puerto Rico and beyond, it‚Äôs poised to become the premier destination for amateur pickleball enthusiasts worldwide.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhether you're a seasoned player or new to the game, The Dink Minor League Pickleball welcomes you to find a team, join the fun, forge new friendships, and experience the thrill of pickleball like never before.\n\n‚Äç\n\nJoin a team, have fun, and experience the excitement of pickleball!¬†Sign up now!\n\n‚Äç\n\nWritten by Alana Jackler"}

Truly a pioneer of the sport!\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis Mother‚Äôs Day, DUPR joins Anna Leigh in honoring the mother of modern pickleball, Leigh Waters.\n\nTraditionally characterized by a gentle finesse, pickleball experienced a transformative shift with Leigh Waters‚Äô entry into professional play. Along with her then twelve-year-old daughter, Anna Leigh, the Waters burst onto the professional pickleball scene and changed it forever.\n\nLeigh and Anna Leigh‚Äôs pickleball journey began amidst the upheaval of Hurricane Irma in 2017. While seeking refuge with Leigh's father in Pennsylvania, he introduced them to pickleball, igniting a passion that led them to enter their first tournament shortly after returning to Florida.\n\nAs a former tennis player on a full scholarship at the University of South Carolina, Leigh‚Äôs background brought out a fierce, unapologetic style to the pickleball court.\n\nRecalling their early days, Leigh reminisces, \"Everyone was still just playing the soft game, and here I am with Anna Leigh, ripping balls, driving, crashing the next ball‚Äîwe took a lot of people off guard.\"\n\nAnna Leigh adds, \"People would tell my mom to ease up, but she stood her ground, saying, ‚ÄòNo, this is working; I'm beating you. Why would I change?‚Äô If asked to slow down, she just hit the ball even harder.\"\n\nBy 2022, Team Waters had become the #1 team in women's doubles in the Professional Pickleball Association (PPA). However, in November Leigh suffered an ACL injury at Nationals, temporarily halting her competitive pursuits.¬†\n\nInitially disheartened, Leigh found solace in coaching during her recovery, nurturing Anna Leigh's talent and watching her thrive.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúI started realizing that this is the best thing for her. This felt like it was her journey. Being there for her and being able to take it all in as a parent rather than a teammate. And I actually found that I loved coaching and didn't really miss the competition. I missed the rec play and all that, like playing with your friends and training, but I didn't really miss the grind of the tournament schedule.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nReflecting on her mother's pivotal influence, Anna Leigh shares, ‚ÄúI definitely don't think I would be the player I am today without my mom's coaching and strategy. I mean, she's really good at coaching, but she's amazing at strategy. She can look at a player and give you their weaknesses and strengths by watching them for five minutes. It's crazy.‚Äù\n\nTheir reunion at the US Open this year marked a triumphant return for Team Waters. However, they have no plans to resume a full tournament schedule together.\n\nAnna Leigh expresses, \"She's not just an athlete; she's a mother, coach, wife, and daughter. She does so many things for our family, and she still somehow has time for herself and everybody else. I'm just so proud of her.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nThis Mother's Day, let's celebrate Leigh Waters‚Äîa trailblazing athlete, devoted coach, and loving mother‚Äîwhose resilience, passion, and unwavering support continue to inspire us all.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBy Alana Jackler\n\n‚Äç"}

Without addressing these underlying issues through targeted strength and mobility training, pickleball players may find themselves sidelined by injuries or unable to improve their skills and perform at their best.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore the science-backed benefits of incorporating strength and mobility training into your pickleball routine and provide you with simple and effective steps you can take today to help you reduce injuries, move more efficiently on the court, and unlock your full potential as a player.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Benefits of Resistance Training for Pickleball Players\n\nResistance training is essential for global health and wellness, but especially for pickleball players. A well-structured plan builds strength, endurance, and resilience to injury.\n\nResearch demonstrates that resistance training:\n\nIncreases fat-free mass & decreases body fat %¬†\nIncreases muscle strength and power\nImproves bone density and balance, reducing the risk of fractures from falls or impacts\nStrengthens tendons and ligaments, minimizing the risk of overuse & traumatic injuries\n\n‚Äç\n\nBy incorporating resistance training at least twice a week, you'll build a strong foundation for your pickleball game and extend your life expectancy. A recent study with over 90,000 participants found a 41% reduction in all-cause mortality when resistance training was combined with at least 150 - 300 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA).¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nAnd yes, pickleball qualifies as MVPA!\n\n‚Äç\n\nDesigning a Resistance Training Plan for Pickleball Players\n\nA well-designed resistance plan should target the major movement patterns: push, pull, hinge, squat, twist, and carry. These movements are functional for daily living and are the foundation of many sporting actions.\n\n\n\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhen designing your resistance training plan, there are a few critical variables to account for:\n\n‚Äç\n\nIntensity\n\nIntensity refers to the weight or resistance you use when performing an exercise. It can come from various sources, such as dumbbells, barbells, resistance bands, or even your body weight. The heavier the load, the more challenging the exercise becomes for your muscles.\n\nIntensity Guidelines\n\nBeginner: If you‚Äôve been doing resistance training for less than 6 months, choose a moderate intensity and focus on performing each exercise with good technical proficiency.\n\nIntermediate: If you‚Äôve been resistance training for less than two years, choose an intensity that challenges but doesn‚Äôt change your form.\n\nAdvanced: If you‚Äôve been resistance training for 2+ years, you‚Äôll need to use higher-intensity loads to continue to see improvement. After several warm-up sets, your primary sets should push you within a few reps of failure while maintaining excellent form.\n\n‚Äç\n\nVolume\n\nVolume refers to the overall workload your muscles handle during a training session or week. It takes into account the number of exercises you perform and the sets and repetitions you complete for each exercise.\n\nA dose of approximately 10 sets per muscle group per week is a general minimum prescription to optimize your workouts. Research indicates there are potential benefits to higher volumes for underdeveloped muscle groups, but you should always progress your volume slowly.¬†\n\nAvoid increasing your total workout volume by more than 15% per week, or you will dramatically increase your risk for injury.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFrequency¬†\n\nThe US Department of Health & Human Services and the World Health Organization recommend that adults perform at least two total body strengthening sessions per week.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nRest Interval¬†\n\nAs a general rule, rest periods should last at least 2 minutes when performing multi-joint exercises. Shorter rest periods (60-90 secs) can be employed for single-joint exercises.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Role of Mobility Training in Pickleball Performance\n\nResearch indicates that improving mobility through targeted exercise programs can reduce the risk of injury in various sports. Mobility refers to the ability to move your joints through their full range of motion and to be strong and stable in those positions.¬†\n\nFor instance, a mobile pickleball player should be able to flex their hips, knees, and ankles at the kitchen line to return shots. An immobile player may place undue stress on their lower back from bowing at the waist instead of bending the hips, knees, and ankles to return shots.\n\nThere are several areas of the body where poor mobility can lead to pain and injury:\n\n‚Äç\n\nAnkles: essential for quick direction changes and to prevent ankle sprains\nHips: important hinging, squatting, and rotating¬†\nShoulders: crucial for overhead shots, serving, dinking, and more\nKnees: critical for squatting and generating force to move quickly\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow & When to Train for Mobility\n\nBecause mobility training is a low-stress activity on the body, it can be done daily. Incorporating mobility exercises into your warm-up and cool-down routines is an efficient way to incorporate them into your exercise plan, and it can significantly impact your performance and injury resilience.¬†\n\nFocus on exercises that move your joints through a full range of motion, such as shoulder, elbow, knee, and hip circles. Squatting and lunging patterns, as well as yoga pushups, are exceptional exercises for enhancing mobility.\n\nHere are a few mobility training exercises you can start today that target various muscle groups of the lower body and upper body to improve overall movement quality:¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nCossack Squat\n\nTargeting hips, hamstrings, and adductors/groin\nStart with your feet wider than your shoulders, toes pointing out.¬†\nLift your arms straight out in front of you, shift your weight onto the right leg, and sit back as if there is a chair behind you.¬†\nKeep the other leg straight, bend the right knee, and lower it as far down as you can without lifting the right heel and keeping the chest lifted.¬†\nReturn to standing and alternate sides until you reach 16-20 repetitions.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nCat-Cow\n\nTargeting spine mobility and upper back\n\n‚Äç\n\nStart on all fours with hands underneath the shoulders, knees underneath the hips, and back straight.¬†\nArch the back, lifting the head and tailbone to the ceiling.¬†\nReverse the movement by rounding the back, tailbone, and shoulders, pulling the belly button towards the spine, and looking towards the hips.¬†\nAlternate positions for a total of 8-10 reps in each position.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n90/90 Hip Rotations\n\nTargeting hip joints and glutes\n\n‚Äç\n\nBegin sitting on your sit bones with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart and knees at a 90-degree angle.¬†\nWith your back straight and core engaged, you can rest your hands behind you for support (progress to lifting your hands and maintaining balance).\nRotate your hips to one side, keep a tall upper body posture, then slowly rotate back to the opposite side, alternating rotations for 8-12 repetitions.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nBONUS:\n\nHere‚Äôs a video sequence for improving knee mobility with Dr. Kyle Richmond, a rehab and mobility expert.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWatch video HERE\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nIntegrating Strength and Mobility Training into Your Pickleball Routine\n\n‚Äç\n\nConsistency is key to reap the full benefits of strength and mobility training.¬†\n\nAim to incorporate resistance training at least twice weekly, focusing on exercises targeting major movement patterns. Also, consider making mobility training a regular part of your pre-and post-match routine or a regular at-home training program.\n\nUsing a personalized training app like AIM7 can help streamline your off-court training. With customized resistance training plans based on your fitness level and available equipment, as well as guided warm-ups, cool-downs, and daily mobility sessions, AIM7 makes it easy to integrate strength and mobility training into your routine.\n\nGet your free 60-day trial by using the code (A760FREE).\n\n‚Äç\n\nConclusion\n\nPickleball is a challenging sport that demands a combination of skill, strength, and mobility. By prioritizing off-court training and incorporating resistance and mobility exercises into your routine, you'll reduce your risk of injury and unlock your full potential on the court.¬†\n\nRemember, the key to success is consistency and a well-designed plan. So grab your weights, resistance bands, and pickleball paddle, and get ready to take your game to the next level!\n\n‚Äç\n\nBy Erik Korem, PhD & Susie Reiner, PhD\n\n‚Äç"}

Six of those coveted spots went to three pairs of siblings: the Kawamoto sisters, Ben and Collin Johns, and Jorja and JW Johnson.\n\nWhether as practice partners, doubles teammates, or competitors, sibling teams have a unique chemistry that is difficult to replicate. Their shared history, communication skills, trust, competitive edge, and motivation all contribute to their success on the court.\n\nFor Jackie and Jade, the sibling advantage has helped them rise rapidly through the ranks of professional pickleball.\n\n‚ÄúJust having that person to always practice with was definitely an advantage for us,‚Äù says Jackie. ‚ÄúI'm a righty and Jade is a lefty, and we move together very well.

We just know each other's game so well.‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúWe've practiced with each other our whole lives, so it comes naturally,‚Äù adds Jade.\n\nLike many professional pickleball players, the Kawamoto sisters have a background in competitive tennis, playing throughout their childhood and into college.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nTheir journey with pickleball began in 2019.\n\n‚ÄúAt first it was just fun, something to do with the family,‚Äù says Jade.¬†\n\n\n‚ÄúIt didn't take long for all of us to get hooked and pretty much play nonstop,‚Äù adds Jackie.\n\nThey started competing in 2021, and in less than 3 years, they‚Äôve become top rated pros. The Dink recently rated Jackie and Jade the number five women‚Äôs doubles team in the world for 2024, and their 5.9+ DUPR ratings demonstrate how far they‚Äôve progressed in their short time since finding the sport.\n\n‚ÄúChemistry is such an important part of this game because of the nature of the game and how quickly it goes,‚Äù Jackie explains.\n\nJade adds that the emotional support is just as important as the training.\n\n‚ÄúWhen you grow up with each other, and you're the same age and have gone through similar experiences‚Ä¶ I know it's a cliche or whatever, but it does help you on the court to have someone that knows your emotions and knows how to bring you up when you're down,‚Äù she says.\n\n\nThis season, that bond faces a new challenge. Where the Kawamoto sisters played together for the ATX Pickleballers in 2023, this year they‚Äôll meet as rivals.\n\nIt‚Äôs fitting, perhaps, that their new teams represent the sister-cities of New York and Los Angeles, two American metropolises that share similarities and a healthy rivalry.\n\nFor Jade and Jackie, meeting head-to-head is an opportunity to keep improving their game.\n\n‚ÄúWe were pretty competitive with each other when we were younger,‚Äù Jackie recalls. ‚ÄúIt always pushed us to be a little bit better.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe still like to be competitive with each other,‚Äù Jade says, ‚Äúbut mostly in a fun-spirited way, not like ‚ÄòI have to be better than you at this‚Äô.

She had a second heart attack on the pickleball court in January 2021 and required two further stents to be fitted. However, her love for the sport is unwavering.\n\n¬†\n\nKath has since led the growth of pickleball on Anglesey and across North Wales, introducing over 200 people to the sport via taster sessions, taking it into schools, helping to train coaches and leaders and accompanying a happy group of players to national competitions.¬†\n\n¬†\n\n‚ÄúI dragged people in off the streets!‚Äù she laughs. ‚ÄúI was determined to encourage others to get off their bums and play this game that had brought sport into my life. This game is truly addictive and the friendship and social interaction is quite unique. What pickleball has done for me is immense. Without it, I‚Äôd just be a moaning old biddy!‚Äù\n\n¬†\n\nAt West Herts Wizards Pickleball Club in Hertfordshire, north of London, 76% of members are over the age of 55. One player in his 70s has dementia but still participates every week, accompanied by his sister.¬†\n\n¬†\n\nWizards‚Äô Club Secretary, Lyn Epps, says: \"He was an excellent tennis player back in the day, and his natural racquet skills come to the fore. Neither he, nor his sister, would mind me saying he never knows what the score is, and we repeat the rules regarding the non-volley zone over and over, to ensure the game goes well and everyone‚Äôs happy!\"\n\n¬†\n\nSue Nicol founded South Suffolk Pickleball Club in East Anglia after her retirement. She calls it \"dangerously addictive.\"¬†\n\n¬†\n\n\"It absolutely hit the spot for me,\" she says. \"As a former Pilates teacher, I saw the potential of pickleball for an aging population. There's a lot of squatting, lateral movement, and, of course, the psychological benefits of how sociable it is.\"\n\n¬†\n\nA significant catalyst for pickleball's growth in the UK has been the University of the 3rd Age (U3A) - a nationwide group of over 1,000 charities who create opportunities for older people to come together, share skills, and learn for fun. It's reported that over 80 U3A groups play pickleball.\n\n¬†\n\nMichael de Groot from Worcestershire discovered pickleball through U3A and is now a qualified coach. Michael believes the social benefits outweigh even the abundant physical and cognitive advantages that older people get from the sport.\n\n‚Äç\n\nMichael de Groot from Worcestershire, UK\n\n¬†\n\nHe says, \"The social interaction on and off court plays a major role in reducing loneliness in older adults and giving them a sense of belonging, and new friendships too. This should not be underestimated. You can see the evidence every week. Players arrive smiling and leave smiling.\"\n\nPickleball is more than just a sport, it is a lifeline, offering newfound joy and purpose. Through the stories of individuals like Kath Knowles, Sue Nicol, and Michael de Groot, we see how pickleball has transformed lives, providing an outlet for overcoming challenges and fostering meaningful connections."}

However, AI in sports is now synonymous with big business. Estimates value the sports AI market at more than $2 billion, and research suggests that it may reach more than $7 billion by 2027. Currently, AI is being used for everything from training NFL players to shaving time off their 40-yard dash to predicting and preventing injuries on the basketball court. And it‚Äôs poised to have a significant impact on the sport of pickleball.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHarnessing the Power of AI for Pickleball\n\nAI systems use mathematical algorithms that generate highly accurate analysis in real time. For pickleball, data can be collected via wearable sensors and high-definition motion capture cameras to record players' footwork, paddle angles, and shot choices. This data can be transformed into a format processed by an algorithm and can be used to train the AI model, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships. The model is then integrated into an application or program and is the basis for making predictions on new data that is collected. The more data it acquires, the more the algorithm adapts and the better its ability to simulate human intelligent processes. Coaches can then reference the data and immediately adjust a player‚Äôs mechanics and techniques, repeat the drill or session, and compare results.\n\nBut AI isn‚Äôt just for pickleball pros. Recreational players are already enjoying the benefits of AI. Training tools like SwingVision and PB Vision bring the power of AI to local courts without the need for high-end equipment or professional-grade video. By uploading footage shot on a smartphone, these systems can analyze player movements, pinpoint problems in swing speed and follow through, and provide suggestions for improvement. In addition, AI is becoming an integral part of emerging pickleball virtual reality (VR) simulations that produce engaging immersive, customized training programs.\n\nIn addition, the recent partnership between leading global pickleball rating system DUPR and sport and AI analytics technology pioneers Playsight has opened up new possibilities. PlaySight‚Äôs AI automated highlights also allow players to relive their best moments in a match instantly. The collaboration promises to redefine how players experience and interact with the sport.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPreventing Injury and Speeding Recovery\n\nOff the court, AI is showing great benefits in improving player health and conditioning. Systems can evaluate heart rate and joint stress and alert players to potential injury. Next-generation pulse oximeters incorporate AI into handheld devices that measure respiratory rate, temperature, and blood saturation levels.¬†\n\nAI can also help accelerate recovery times from injuries. Trainers and physical therapists are increasingly relying on AI-generated results to create personalized rehab programs to get players back on the court faster and prevent re-injury.\n\nIn addition, manufacturers of pickleball equipment, especially paddle companies, are using AI-powered systems to determine material specifications and performance metrics for the design of their newest products. Because of its ability to perform analysis on a microscopic level, AI can identify the optimal materials for improved power, control, and durability and give manufacturers next-level customization options to develop paddles suited for a variety of playing styles. These advancements are poised to propel paddle sales, which are projected to reach $253.8 million by 2028 and are currently more than $125 million in the US alone.\n\nIt's an exciting time for pickleball and AI will continue to play an ever-expanding role in the sport‚Äôs future. As more players tap into AI‚Äôs ability to achieve better results on the court, it‚Äôs likely there‚Äôll be a corresponding increase in their DUPR ratings.\n\n‚Äç"}

What was even starker is that when a nation of 1.4 billion people gets a taste for a new sport, it can create high volumes of participation quickly!\n\n¬†\n\n\"The region is poised to go 'boom!'\" smiled David after meeting with partners, athletes, sponsors, club owners, local dignitaries and celebrities in Mumbai to raise awareness of the benefits of DUPR (or \"humanizing the algorithm,\" as he neatly calls it).\n\n¬†\n\nDavid added: \"The best question about the level of play in India is not to ask how far they are behind the States, but how far along they are. Let me tell you, these guys are doing very well indeed!\n\n¬†\n\nThe tournament was a real eye-opener for some of the US pros. When they got into those rapid hand battles, it wasn't a series of blocks and speedups ‚Äî the Indian athletes were actually redirecting their attacks with spin on the ball. These guys are used to badminton where a shuttlecock reaches speeds of nearly 500 km/h, so pickleball is virtually in slow motion for them.\"\n\n¬†\n\nDavid was particularly taken by the current Indian No. 1 Harsh Mehta: \"Until he hits it, you just don't know whether he's going to roll it, cut it or flick it.

With more and more colleges and universities developing pickleball club teams, DUPR‚Äôs Collegiate Pickleball tournament series offers the most regional and national opportunities for¬† individual and team collegiate competition, with the added bonus of competing for scholarship money.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚ÄúWe are thrilled to support DUPR Collegiate Pickleball and partner with DUPR to offer more incentives, perks and opportunities for student athletes to compete in the world‚Äôs best game,‚Äù said Chad Phillips, president of Rally Republic. ‚ÄúDUPR Collegiate is the sport‚Äôs premier college series and we are looking forward to exposing our brand in front of student athletes and fans, and generating even more excitement and buzz for pickleball among this audience.‚Äù¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nRally Republic‚Äôs line of licensed paddles featuring school and university names and mascots are incredibly popular with athletes, alumni and fans alike, not only for showcasing school pride but also for their high-quality handling and performance.

Each individual player‚Äôs points are accumulated based on their team‚Äôs performance at official The Dink Minor League Pickleball events.\n\n\n\nHow to Qualify and Get on the Leaderboard\n\nThere are two ways to qualify for The Dink MiLP National Championship:\n\nLocal The Dink MiLP Events\nThe Dink MiLP Regional Showdowns\n\n‚Äç\n\nNational Pathway #1: Local The Dink MiLP Events\n\nLocal The Dink MiLP Events are hosted all across the USA.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe National Leaderboard keeps track of the points of every individual in each division. Top players from the leaderboard will receive an invitation to the National Championship.\n\nPlayers play as a team but earn points towards Nationals as an individual.\nFor example, if a DUPR division has 8 teams, the 1st place team members will receive 8 points each, the 2nd place team members will receive 7 points each, the 3rd place team members will receive 6 points each and so on through last place. Members of the last place team will each receive 1 point each.¬†\nAt all The Dink MiLP local events, the 1st place team members will receive at least a minimum of 4 points each. The maximum will be based on the total number of teams.¬†\nIf you play multiple divisions within the 2024 season, your points stay within each division.¬†\nOnce a player qualifies for Nationals, the player is then tasked with forming a team. The team can be made up of teammates from the 2024 season or any players who have played in any official The Dink Minor League events from the qualifying season.\nA player can participate in multiple teams throughout the season, but can only compete in one team at the National Championship.\nThe team will be placed into the appropriate DUPR division based on their total team aggregate at the time of registration. Once a team registers for Nationals, their ratings are ‚Äúlocked‚Äù and their DUPR increasing or decreasing will not impact the team‚Äôs aggregate or division placement.\n\n\n\nNational Pathway #2: The Dink MiLP Regional Showdowns\n\nThe Dink MiLP organizers will be hosting a total of 7 tournaments in different regions of the USA.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nThese Regional Showdowns will include 12 to 16 teams per division. At each event, the 1st place teams from each division will receive a Dream Ticket to the National Championship.\n\n\n\nAll Regional Showdown players will earn points towards their respective DUPR Divisions on the National Leaderboard (including the 1st place team).¬†\nA team that earns a Dream Ticket to the National Championship will compete in the division in which they qualified regardless of their DUPR aggregate at registration as long as the entire team is intact (all 4 players stay the same). If any players of the team are substituted, the team will be placed in the appropriate aggregate at the time of registration.¬†\nIf a team that received a Dream Ticket cannot attend the National Championship with all 4 of its original teammates, they can choose to replace up to 2 teammates with players who have competed in The Dink MiLP events during the 2024 qualifying season.\nIf a 1st place team cannot attend Nationals with at least 2 of its original Regionals‚Äô teammates, the 2nd place team will be offered their Dream Ticket to Nationals.\n\n‚Äç\n\nSign up now for a The Dink Minor League Pickleball event to get your name and points on the National Leaderboard and earn your spot at The Dink MiLP‚Äôs pinnacle event, The Dink Minor League Pickleball National Championship 2024.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n*Sign Up Now*¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nTo learn more about The Dink Minor League Pickleball, visit our website.

Among them were veteran teams like Arizona State, University of Utah, and Loyola Marymount, alongside newcomers to DUPR collegiate pickleball such as Stanford and Brigham Young University.\n\n‚Äç\n\nFour of the teams that competed are ranked top ten in the DUPR Power Rankings that came out this past week on DUPR, and three of those teams are ranked top six. Not surprisingly, each one of these schools earned themselves a bid to nationals:\n\n‚Äç\n\n#1 Utah Tech\n#3 Utah Valley\n#6 Utah State\n#10 Grand Canyon\n\n‚Äç\n\nHowever, the biggest story of the tournament was Utah Valley‚Äôs performance. Utah Valley was the only school this weekend that had multiple teams win every match in their group stage. The #1 team from Utah Valley won every single of their eight matches without dropping a single game against their opponents. In the finals, they handed Utah Tech their first-ever 0-3 match loss and first-ever finals loss in a regional tournament.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nWill Utah Tech (or another team from the west) step up and take the crown back from Utah Valley?

From earning your initial rating to honing your skills through gameplay, every step shapes your pickleball experience.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nIn this chat, Dave and Sarah will tackle common questions players encounter when starting their DUPR journey. Let's explore starting out, finding good playing partners, and understanding match count.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key takeaways:\n\n‚Äç\n\n1. Getting Started:\n\nQuestion: How do I get my first rating as a DUPR user?\nAnswer: Simply play a match! Once you've recorded your first game on DUPR, your rating will be generated based on factors like the skill level of your opponents and the outcome of the match.\n\n‚Äç\n\n2. Playing Partners:\n\nQuestion: Who should I play with to get an accurate rating?\nAnswer: Playing with rated players is ideal. However, playing with unrated players is still beneficial, even though it is less precise. The more matches you play, the more accurate your rating becomes.\n\n‚Äç\n\n3. Match Count:\n\nQuestion: How many matches do I need to play for an accurate rating?\nAnswer: Aim for at least 10 to 20 matches. Quality matters too; ensure you're playing at the right level and experiencing a mix of wins and losses in close games.\n\n‚Äç\n\n4. Rating Movement:\n\nQuestion: Can my rating go down if I win?\nAnswer: Yes, it is possible that your rating will go down after a win, if you have performed at a lower level than expected in that match. Alternatively, you also have the ability to go up after a loss, if you have performed at a higher level than expected in that match.\n\n‚Äç\n\n5. Fair Play:\n\nQuestion: How do I handle concerns about playing with unrated players?\nAnswer: We strongly encourage rated players to play with new or unrated players to help them begin their DUPR journey. This inclusive approach fosters community growth and helps new players integrate into the rating system. Since the algorithm considers the match history of all participants, matches involving unrated or low-reliability players will have a smaller impact on the rated player‚Äôs DUPR‚Äîespecially if that player has a high reliability score.\n\n‚Äç\n\n6. How to Raise Your Rating:\n\nQuestion: Should I aim to beat lower-rated players to boost my rating?\nAnswer: Not necessarily. Your rating is based on how you perform compared to the expected score ‚Äî not just whether you win. If you're a heavy favorite, you may need a dominant score like 11‚Äì3 to see a gain. To increase your rating, focus on outperforming expectations and showing that you're playing above your current level.\n\n‚Äç\n\n7. Recording Matches:\n\nQuestion: What if my match partner refuses to validate scores?\nAnswer: It's crucial to uphold fair play standards. Communicate with your partner beforehand and report any violations to DUPR for investigation.\n\n‚Äç\n\n8. Club Participation:\n\nQuestion: How can joining a DUPR club benefit my rating?\nAnswer: Club matches provide consistent opportunities to play at a competitive level, contributing to the accuracy of your rating with verified match results.\n\n‚Äç\n\n9. Match Dynamics:\n\nQuestion: How does match format (e.g., one game vs. best two out of three) affect my rating?\nAnswer: Longer match formats yield more data and have a greater impact on your rating, as they provide a better indication of your skill level.\n\n‚Äç\n\n10. Past Results:\n\nQuestion: Can I input past match results to improve my rating?\nAnswer: Yes, past results can be added to your profile, but recent matches hold more weight in determining your current rating.\n\n‚Äç\n\n11. Rating Decay:\n\nQuestion: What happens if I stop playing and logging matches?\nAnswer: Your rating remains stable, but the reliability of your rating decreases over time due to the decay of match recency. Returning to regular match logging will restore reliability.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR isn't just a rating system; it's a community-driven platform designed to elevate your pickleball experience.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor more insights and updates, please stay connected with DUPR through our app, website, social media channels, and newsletter. We're here to support you on your pickleball journey, one match at a time.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDisclaimer: The responses provided in this blog post are based on the conversation between Dave and Sarah, and are subject to updates and revisions by DUPR.\n\n‚Äç"}

It's great for welcoming newcomers and connecting with players of all abilities within the pickleball community.\n\nThat‚Äôs where DUPR comes in.\n\nAs the only global pickleball rating system that uses the same scale to rate players regardless of their age, gender, or location, DUPR ensures that players enjoy fun and competitive games.¬†\n\nWith hundreds of thousands of players, more than 2,000 clubs, and located in over 150 countries, you can easily find equally matched opponents almost anywhere.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre on vacation, meeting new players in your local area, or competing in pickleball events, with DUPR‚Äôs rating system you‚Äôre sure to find players matching your skill level.\n\nHaving a DUPR rating means that you are part of a curated group of players.

You‚Äôll always know an opponent‚Äôs current skill level, whether they are relatively new to the game or highly experienced. Having a DUPR rating also shows that you are active in maintaining and building the community spirit that pickleball is known for. Asking ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your DUPR?‚Äù is a great way to introduce yourself to new players and often leads to an exchange of shot tips, strategies, and product information.

It also demonstrates that you have a solid understanding of pickleball rules and etiquette. From kitchen violations to foot faults and the two-bounce rule, your DUPR rating demonstrates that you‚Äôre committed to fair play and know the rules of the game. As a result, players with DUPR ratings are more likely to follow pickleball rules and protocols.

It‚Äôs a much-needed break from serious class work and a chance to run around, play with friends, and expend energy playing basketball, soccer, volleyball, and floor hockey. Today, an increasing number of schools are adding pickleball to the menu as a way to provide students with a fun, easy way to increase physical activity and combat childhood obesity while addressing their ever-shrinking budgets.\n\n¬†\n\nTailor-Made For Schools\n\nMany aspects that have made pickleball so popular with adults ‚Äì it‚Äôs easy to learn, it‚Äôs a fun workout, games are quick, and it allows people of various abilities and fitness levels to play together ‚Äì also make it a great fit for school gym classes. Students can progress very quickly, which builds up their self-esteem and a sense of accomplishment and can lead to improvements in their overall academic achievement.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPickleball is also ideal for schools because it solves the problem of how to provide students with a fun physical activity while adhering to tight budgets. According to The Society of Health and Physical Educators, (SHAPE America), the average elementary school spends only $462 per year on physical education. That‚Äôs not per child ‚Äîthat‚Äôs for the entire school. Given these constraints, pickleball provides a cost-effective activity that many students can play while meeting government mandates for physical education.\n\n¬†\n\nDUPR Fuels the Growth of Pickleball Among Younger Players¬†\n\nThe Sports & Fitness Industry Association (SFIA) estimates that 8.9 million people played pickleball in 2023. As the average age of pickleball participants continues to trend downward ‚Äì it‚Äôs currently at 35 ‚Äì DUPR is working with organizations across the country to expand the sport further among younger players. For example, the most recent National Junior Pickleball Championships powered by DUPR was held in October in Las Vegas and featured 113 boys and girls ranging in age from 9-18 competing in singles, doubles, and team tournaments.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nBringing Pickleball to Schools\n\nIn addition to DUPR‚Äôs efforts, the nonprofit organization PHIT America is making it easy for schools to add pickleball to their physical education curriculum. PHIT America‚Äôs Play Pickleball initiative donates everything a school needs ‚Äì paddles, nets, balls, training aids -- to introduce pickleball to students. Launched in Spring 2023 with the ambitious goal of delivering more than 100 kits to elementary schools throughout the US, PHIT America is partnering with pickleball pro KaSandra Gerke to spread the word about the fun and health benefits kids can enjoy from playing pickleball.\n\n¬†\n\nPickleball is all about teamwork and good sportsmanship and therefore fits nicely with the values schools teach every day. The sport‚Äôs explosive growth over the past few years is poised to continue, and anyone who has watched an MLP or PPA match is witnessing the success younger players are having on tour. Seventeen-year-old Anna Leigh Waters continues to dominate and teen phenoms Hayden Patriquin and Quang Duong consistently compete at the highest levels. You never know, somewhere in America a student could be picking up a paddle in gym class for the first time, get hooked on the sport and soon play in a few pickleball tournaments, get their DUPR rating, and maybe become tomorrow‚Äôs next great pickleball champion."}

A continuing surge in the growth of the sport paired with the ever-present ‚Äúwill they/won‚Äôt they‚Äù relationship between the MLP and the PPA saw DUPR spun out from its former MLP umbrella and into a verdant green pasture of new ownership and an opportunity to fully take the reins on our own destiny.\n\nWith the changing of the guard, DUPR can refocus on what it can do best‚Äîprovide universal, ageless, and genderless ratings for recreational players and professionals alike to foster competitive matches, ensure honest tournament entries, and find partners to play with or against no matter where in the world you are.\n\nYou‚Äôve heard that story before and maybe you‚Äôve bought in and are along for the ride or maybe you‚Äôve been burned before and are feeling a little skeptical. This series of blog posts I‚Äôll be writing in the coming weeks is for both of you as we build up to the release of our first algo change reintroducing the points effect since THE algo change back in June. For those of you with your DUPR-branded bucket hats already atop your head, this is a chance to get a peek behind the scenes at what a real research and sports analytics team looks like now that we can be, first and foremost, a research and sports analytics team. For those of you remaining dubious, I hope this provides insights into how we learn from the past, how we approach the problems to solve, and can demonstrate that, while we are certainly ever-imperfect (as all science is), we take this responsibility seriously and have the process in place to deliver results.\n\n\nA History and What We‚Äôve Learned\n\nFor a relatively young company, DUPR has certainly seen its fair share of iterations. I‚Äôm sure there are more nuanced stratifications to be drawn, but from an algorithmic side, we‚Äôve basically lived 2 lives:\n\nOnce-Per-Week Ratings Update\nInstant and Transparent Results\n\nEach of these algorithm styles has its pros and cons that need to be balanced across all of the company‚Äôs objectives‚Äìnamely, in our case, user experience and accuracy. Let‚Äôs dive in.\n\nOnce-Per-Week Ratings Update\n\nThe original algo, characterized by its update every week, moved slowly. For many of our enthusiastic players eagerly participating in matches throughout the week, the anticipation of seeing their DUPR rating update every Tuesday was a unique experience but lacked the benefits of instant gratification. Further, by combining the effects of an entire week‚Äôs performance into one single ratings move, it was hard to understand the effects and build faith in its quality. More often than not, the algo was working ‚Äúas intended‚Äù, but there was absolutely no way for you to go back and verify, leading to skepticism and distrust. Clearly, the user experience needed an overhaul.\n\nBut ‚Äúworking as intended‚Äù for this algo was also quite raw; in places where the model couldn‚Äôt completely solve a problem, heuristics were used to hold the ship together. This is not altogether uncommon. In many algorithms across industries, heuristics are used to optimize a secondary constraint: labor-hours. If you can put something out into the world that moves the needle in a positive direction, the next biggest improvement may be had by going out and finding a second or third needle to positively move rather than spending far more time on needle number one. As long as you‚Äôre not looking for these needles in a quantitative haystack, you‚Äôre probably better off going out and finding one. When DUPR started, the problem of accurate pickleball ratings was less of a quantitative haystack and more of a quantitative needle-stack.\n\nOne of the needles we uncovered ended up being crucially important: connectivity.\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow do you accurately compare Player A to Player B if they‚Äôve never met, and may not even be in the same state or even country?\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat happens as those connections grow or change? The full deep-dive into this thought process is worthy of its own blog post (and it will absolutely be one down the line when we also talk about ratings reliability!), but the important visualization here is that pickleball is a web of relationships, and information flows through these relationships in a definable and studyable way. Unlike most other sports with highly connected infrastructures that ship their players around the country to play each other in person (football, basketball, hockey, soccer, etc.,) or those with online presences that can generate artificial proximity (online chess and other forms of E-Gaming), pickleball is still relatively disjointed and communal.\n\nA graphical representation of every doubles pickleball match on DUPR. Each node is a player and each line is a match, clustered by strength of connection.\n\nThe initial connectivity solution provided a significant boost in the accuracy of the system, but without the tools in place at the time to explain it, it contributed to effectively all of the confusion among the users of that system.\n\nWe understood this confusion was a significant issue in the original approach and demanded a change, but the complexities of this transition, both mathematically and technically, were immense.\n\nInstant and Transparent Results\n\nFaced with tight deadlines and a focus on immediate solutions, the team worked diligently to address emerging issues. This rapid pace naturally placed significant demands on the tech stack, particularly when managing the data infrastructure requirements of large-scale, instantaneous updates for the entire population. The initially simplistic effects of an instantaneous algo and the prerequisites around things like unrated player initialization had to be solved in real time after going live. Eventually, after having whacked all of the moles, we got ourselves back to a steady state and were able to take a breath and try to take a pulse on the ecosystem at-large.\n\nOne thing was incredibly clear.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDespite the bugs, engagement was up with DUPR. Like, UP up. Getting immediate and transparent results was so gratifying to the user base as compared to the previous version that we saw the fastest growth in match entry per user than we had ever seen and new users were flooding the platform at the highest rate in company history.\n\n‚Äç\n\nBeing able to know that ‚Äúwinning meant going up‚Äù gave players a concrete DUPR goal that aligned with their pickleball goal for a given match. Whereas the population of users (mostly) understands and believes that accounting for every single point would be more accurate, there was no denying that having no idea the amount of points you‚Äôd need to score in a given match to go up could lead to frustrations, especially if it was never explained why a rating had changed after the fact!\n\nImmediacy was fun and transparency was key.\n\nBut the transition was bumpier than we had hoped for and the algorithm needed a few rounds of iteration until we got back to the plant-wide accuracy we expect from DUPR.\n\n\nGoing Forward\n\nWe knew we couldn‚Äôt move away from immediacy and transparency, and obviously we needed a way to reintroduce that crucial element of connectivity. So now, with the ability to forge our own research and development path as we see fit, the question becomes: How do we generate the most accurate possible system within the constraints of that user experience? Well, for that, we first need to understand what we mean by accuracy.\n\n\nHow We Measure Accuracy\n\nI ask you to predict the outcome of a coin toss and the chance that it ends up on heads. (I also ask that you bear with me for some very light math‚Ä¶ I promise). Common sense has likely given you the answer to the question already: 50%. Imagine you are asked to evaluate two different models that are in the business of predicting coin tosses (if you have a good one, please let me know and we can make some Super Bowl Prop Bets together this year‚Ä¶).\n\nModel 1 says there is a 55% chance of landing on heads\nModel 2 says there is a 100% chance of landing on heads\n\nWhen comparing these two models, both of them guess ‚Äúheads‚Äù every time and get the answer right 50% of the time. Yet, clearly, both of these models are ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. The right answer to guess is, of course, 50% (although a recent paper that looked at 351k real coin flips says there‚Äôs actually a ~51% chance a coin tends to land on the same side it started on!), but there are gradients to wrong-ness that clearly don‚Äôt come out by just seeing how many times our guess was right.\n\nFor instance, the moment we ever get a coin flip that lands on tails, we can definitively say that Model 2 is instantly and completely discredited. It thought tails was literally impossible and failed to account for the fundamental randomness and noise in the process of a coin flip. Model 1 more correctly aligns with that fundamental randomness, but maybe not enough.\n\nWe need to measure both how often we‚Äôre correct and whether we are well calibrated to that fundamental randomness. Being correct as often as you think you ought to be correct is just as important as getting the actual heads/tails guess right. If you think a coin has a 51% chance of landing on heads, you‚Äôd want to observe yourself being correct guessing heads about 51% of the time. If you were correct in guessing heads 100% of the time, then your model wasn‚Äôt as confident as it could‚Äôve been, despite it guessing correctly 100% of the time.\n\nThere are numerous statistical ways to evaluate this, but the important takeaway (while staying underneath my mathy-ness budget) is that writing an algorithm that is meant to accurately predict which team wins a match of pickleball is both about constructing a guess that, on average, is more right than wrong and simultaneously is trying to think about how confident its guess is in the first place.\n\n\nHow We Advance from Here\n\nOk, so we have an algorithmic starting place and we have a barometer of success, but how do we actually take the former and achieve the latter? Over the past few weeks, the analytics team has been able to rewrite and modernize our research pipeline from scratch under the sound principles that are required of a project being built for the scale and duration we envision for DUPR.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWe created a full-fledged simulation engine with an ever-increasing list of model hyperparameters that we can now strategically and confidently tune through how they improve our success measurements, and have modularized our algorithm so that each individual component can be studied and improved specifically.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe hard work has been done to make the analytics workflow easy. Now the process is relatively straightforward:\n\nDefine a research project\nGenerate a model that fits into our engine and expose its hyperparameters to the simulator\nRun the simulator over the grid of possible values\nPick the result that improves the predictive ability the most\n\nRinse. Repeat. Refine.\n\nIn the coming weeks, I‚Äôll be continuing this series diving into how this has been applied at DUPR so far as well as poking around in some other fun curiosities. I hope you stay tuned and enjoy the behind the scenes look at DUPR‚Äôs analytical process!\n\n‚Äç\n\nFor the most up-to-date information on how your rating is calculated, please visit our How It Works page.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWritten By: Scott Mendelssohn - Head of Analytics, DUPR\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç"}

Our system is constantly evolving to provide the most accurate and fair ratings possible. For the most up-to-date information on how your rating is calculated, please visit our How It Works page.\n\n‚Äç\n\nAfter months of research and gathering feedback from users, we are excited to announce that on January 30th, 2024, we will release key updates and improvements to the DUPR algorithm. We are confident these updates will create even more accuracy within our rating and a better experience for pickleball players everywhere.\n\nTomorrow, we're releasing a new blog post that provides a behind-the-scenes look at DUPR's research process and how it contributes to the continual advancement of the algorithm.\n\nAs of January 30th, 2024, DUPR takes into account:\n\nPoints Matter. Was this a tight match or a blowout? DUPR now evaluates the closeness of the match, so a score of 11-0 will have a bigger impact on your rating than a close match of 11-9 against that same opponent\nRecency Matters. A match you played today will impact your rating more than a match you played six months ago.\nTotal Match Count Matters. If you've played in a lot of matches, your rating will fluctuate less compared to a player with a lower match count.\nEvery Match Matters (even against unrated players). Every match counts towards your rating, even if you are playing against someone who is unrated or new to DUPR.\n\n\nFAQs\n\nSo what does the updated rating mean for you? We‚Äôve tried to answer the most common questions from our community below.\n\nDo these changes start now or will they be applied to all my past matches?\n\nThese updates will be applied across all your match results in our platform on January 30th, as well as to all future results you submit. Want to ensure your rating is accurate and up to date? Hit the court and share your results.\n\nWhy is DUPR updating the algorithm again? Is this going to happen frequently?\n\nOur team of data scientists is dedicated to ensuring DUPR is the world‚Äôs best and most accurate global pickleball rating. As we get more players and results onto the platform, and have more data at our disposal, we are able to make improvements and updates to the system to ensure that DUPR is providing the most accurate assessment of level. We‚Äôre confident that each of these updates will improve the foundational accuracy of the rating. On 1/26/2024, we're releasing a blog post that provides a behind-the-scenes look at DUPR's research process and how it contributes to the continual advancement ¬†of the algorithm. Will be linked here.\n\nWhen do matches start to matter less? Is there a certain number of matches that count more (ie my most recent 5 matches)? When do matches start losing their value?\n\nThe weight of each match decays with each day that passes by. That means that any match played on the same day will have the same weight before considering the number of sets in the match. The match weight decays smoothly, so there is no cutoff for when a match is no longer counting.\n\nWhat if all the players involved are not rated?\n\nIf all players are unrated, we do not know the level of the match, so we take a guess that the level is 3.5. The outcome of the match will push one team above 3.5 and the other below to properly reflect the levels displayed by the scores of the match. With each player‚Äôs next few matches, they will be able to move quickly toward their appropriate level, especially once they are playing rated players around their skill level.\n\nWill my rating change if I haven‚Äôt logged in matches for a long period of time? I have 200 games entered but haven‚Äôt played in a year. How does that affect my rating?\n\nA pause in playing will not directly affect your rating, but rather your reliability. In order to keep a reliable rating, we recommend that you continue to participate in DUPR logged or reported matches on a regular basis. If you jump back in after a break, you can expect some fluctuations in your rating in your first few matches back since your rating reached a low level of reliability. Once you record more matches, your rating will start to stabilize again and more accurately represent your current skill level.\n\nStill have questions? Our support team is here to help.

With a background in college tennis and investment banking, his competitive and fearless nature led him to pursue professional pickleball at the highest level in the country. During the interview, he discusses his experience in his initial Minor League event, his journey to the Major Leagues, and his personal views on the DUPR rating system.\n\n‚Äç\n\n¬†How did you first hear about Minor League Pickleball and what made you try it?\n\n‚ÄúI was still working full time at that point and just getting into pickleball and a couple of buddies were forming a team and they were like, ‚ÄúDo you want to come out this weekend to play this tournament?‚Äù It'll be a fun team event. Having come from college tennis, it instantly was appealing in that regard and it was awesome. I also didn't have to give up any work at that time. So it's kind of playing that balancing act where the regular tournament started Thursday. This was a perfect opportunity to get out there play a tournament and meet a ton of people with a few good buddies. So I was stoked to get out there and play with them.‚Äù¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n¬†Any standout moments or experiences from your first time at Minor League?\n\n\"Having that scoring (MLPlay) there puts a little more pressure. It got me hooked a little bit more on pickleball coming from not really competing the last couple of years and just working in investment banking. I was able to get out there and have that Collegiate environment, which was a ton of fun. I remember us just battling it out. There was pool play which was also¬†fun. You just got to see a lot of different teams and then you ended up with semis and finals which was a super cool way to do it.‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nDo you think playing Minor League Pickleball prepared you to play Major League Pickleball? Was there a smooth transition? Any adjustments, both in your game and mentally?\n\n\"Yes. I think the level of errors goes down and so in Minor League, you get used to the format and the style of it, but you can still get away with a lot of stuff that's not going to work in Challenger (Major League Pickleball).¬† Each level has its challenges, but Minor League helped me build confidence and get used to the format. The jump was significant, especially in the first Challenger event. The pressure increased, and you have to fully trust your game. Facing top players in premier level MLP means every match is a battle out there, so it's just getting used to those levels and putting in the work on the reps so you can fully trust your game.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nWho would you recommend Minor League for, and why?\n\n\"Minors is great for those entering the sport and wanting their first exposure, or just looking to have a good time. It got my foot in the door and got some buzz around my name but it's also fun for those players who are just looking to have a good time. The Minor League events are out there, and it's a cool way to make a little bit of money and play the sport that you love. Like the one I attended, it added a fun twist with team costumes where the winner of the contest received money. It's not just competitive;¬† it's also a place where you can go and hang out after the matches and just talk to everyone. It's a great stepping stone, but then you want to be focusing on the PPA tour stops to make that jump.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhat are your thoughts on pickleball ratings and accuracy overall?\n\n\"DUPR does a good job of collecting more data, especially for lower levels. I know when I was first getting into the sport I had to call and ask about getting my ranking properly adjusted so I could play pro tournaments and it just wasn't picking up certain things and wasn't as Dynamic. I think DUPR has a great kind of functionality on capturing those earlier players and putting a ranking on them to at least help them make sure they're in an event but I think sandbagging is always gonna be prevalent. No matter how you slice it. It's just trying to mitigate it as much as possible.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nHow important is having an accurate rating for the sport, and should there be one standardized system?\n\n\"I don't look at ratings much but being able to accurately get that having one system out there that can just put a value on everyone. It is so important and I think that's just going to be crucial. The more systems you have the more confusing it gets so it's just the more you can standardize that the better it's gonna be.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nLastly, any feedback for DUPR 's improvement?\n\"I love the DUPR system. I think it's great for some of the waterfall events and just being able to have that flexibility in these different formats is awesome. I think the cool thing about DUPR is you have been constantly tinkering with the system, experimenting with it. I like that because it's a learning process, figuring out what makes sense from my perspective. I'm not as close to that stuff. I think, for the pro level, DUPR does a cool job showing probabilities.\"\n\n‚Äç\n\nFollow Connor's pickleball journey on Instagram.\n\nView the full interview on our YouTube channel.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç"}

If any of these teams already possess a bid, the opportunity for a bid will extend to the next highest-ranking team that does not have one. In some cases, schools may need to engage in an additional match to determine which team will receive the extended bid opportunity.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThe Team Bracket will consist of MLP teams from each school, where there are 2-3 men and 2-3 women players on each team. It will operate the same as our 2023 Regionals, where teams will play Women‚Äôs Doubles, Men‚Äôs Doubles, 2 Mixed Doubles, and potentially a Dreambreaker to determine a winner between teams. The Challenger Bracket will be an open doubles tournament, unless we have enough players sign up to split into Men‚Äôs Doubles/Mixed Doubles/Women‚Äôs Doubles.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nSchools may bring an unlimited number of teams and challenger players. Any school may attend any Super Regional.\n\n‚Äç\n\nEntry Requirements\n\nHave a DUPR account with a doubles rating\nBe taking at least 6 credit hours at the school you are representing\nBe partnered with other players from your school (applies to both the team and challenger brackets)\n\n‚Äç\n\nEmail college@mydupr.com to have a team bracket made for your school in the Regional you want to attend. Your team bracket players will register in that bracket we made for you, and all challenger bracket players will register in the bracket labeled ‚ÄúChallenger Bracket‚Äù\n\n‚Äç\n\nCampus Regionals\n\nCampus Regionals are a way for DUPR Collegiate Pickleball to work with individual clubs running their own collegiate tournaments. If your club is running a collegiate tournament, and it meets certain requirements, the tournament can be a part of our Campus Regional series. Each Campus Regional will receive a Nationals bid to give out, as well as be featured on the DUPR Collegiate Pickleball website. Only 16 tournaments will be selected for the Campus Regional series in 2024.

Schools will be split into 16 groups of 4, and every single team will advance to the single-elimination playoffs, March Madness style. MLP teams are still guaranteed 6 matches, no matter their performance. There will also be a challenger bracket at the 2024 CNC, which will operate similar to the 2023 CNC challenger bracket.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nTo participate in the team brackets at CNC, a school must:\n\nHave obtained a bid\nParticipated in a Regional (either a Super Regional or a Campus Regional)\nHave all of their players be current students at the college they are representing and taking at least 6 credit hours\n\n‚Äç\n\nTo participate in the challenger bracket at CNC, players must:\n\nBe partnered up with someone from their same college\nBe current students taking at least 6 credit hours at the college they are representing\nA bid is NOT required to have players from your school compete in the challenger bracket\n\n‚Äç\n\nDual Matches\n\nReady to challenge your local rivals? Got a free weekend and craving some Collegiate Pickleball? We have just the solution - introducing DUPR Duals. This new initiative will allow teams to organize matches against each other that count towards their team record and ranking. All dual matches following this format will be featured on the DUPR Collegiate Pickleball website. Here is the link to our doc explaining how to conduct a dual match with another school.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR Collegiate Council\n\nDUPR is the home of collegiate pickleball, and we want to make sure that we continue to foster open communication and collaboration with our player base. In 2024, we will organize a DUPR Collegiate Council that will be made up of leaders and players from each region of collegiate pickleball. The DUPR Collegiate Council and DUPR‚Äôs Collegiate Team will meet regularly to discuss feedback on previous events, the steps that DUPR is taking to grow the sport, and your input on what we can do to increase each player‚Äôs experience. Participation in the DUPR Collegiate Council will be by invitation only. If you are interested in lending your experience to help us grow collegiate pickleball, you may apply here.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPower Rankings and Leaderboard\n\nPower Rankings are back for 2024!¬†The goal of our Power Rankings is to answer the question: \"Which school would win the Collegiate National Championship if it were held today?\". Power Rankings are calculated by aggregating the highest doubles DUPRs from the top 2 men and top 2 women from a school. In order for a school to be on the Power Rankings, they must have brought a MLP team to any Super Regional, Campus Regional, Dual Match, or event from 2022 & 2023. To be eligible to count towards their college's power ranking, a player 1) must still be a current student at that college, 2) must have played in any DUPR event, and 3) must have a doubles DUPR. Spring, summer, and fall graduates have until July 31st, August 31st, and December 31st, respectively, before their student status is removed.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPower Rankings will be released on the first Friday of every month. The full list is available at our website here.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWe have added the Leaderboard to our website, which tracks all of the matches, games, and points from every Super Regional, Campus Regional, and Dual Match. The goal of the Leaderboard is to provide a way to compare the stats of each school to each other, and to provide insight into which schools are winning the highest % of their matches, games, and points. The Leaderboard has no effect on bids or tournament seeding.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR Regions\n\nIntroducing DUPR Regions - Teams are split up into different regions based on geographic location. These regions were decided based on a variety of factors, and with the ever-growing collegiate pickleball landscape, we shall review regional splits on an annual basis. DUPR Regions will allow players to be eligible for regional awards, experience heightened rivalries, and access more competitive opportunities.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPlease note - Due to the current distribution of Collegiate Pickleball teams, not all regions will have the same amount of Super/Campus Regionals for 2024. Teams can compete in any regional tournament they wish, regardless of their assigned region.\n\n‚Äç\n\nSee below to see what region your team belongs to -¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR Awards\n\nStarting in 2024, DUPR shall implement the inaugural DUPR Collegiate Pickleball Awards! This initiative aims to reward players, coaches, and programs for their contributions to the success of DUPR Collegiate Pickleball on and off the court. These awards will be decided by the DUPR Collegiate Council and will be given out at the 2024 Collegiate National Championship during the awards banquet.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR All-American¬†\n\nHonors the top 4 male and top 4 female players based on multiple performance criteria as judged by the DUPR Collegiate Council.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR Scholar-Athlete\n\nHave a minimum GPA of 3.7\nBe a full-time student\nCompeted in a DUPR Super Regional¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR Rookie of the Year\n\nHonors a first-year student who made significant contributions to his/her team in the areas of leadership, sportsmanship, and performance.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR Senior Player of the Year\n\nHonors the senior student who had the best year among all players in his/her class in areas of leadership, sportsmanship, and performance.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR Coach of the Year\n\nHonors a coach who has exhibited outstanding leadership in ways that contribute to on and off-court team performance.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR Community Service Award (Team)\n\nHonors a team that gives back to their campus and their community through pickleball and non-pickleball pathways.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDUPR Ambassador of the Year\n\nDUPR will recognize two students (1 male, 1 female) who advance the mission of DUPR by devoting consistent time and effort to promotional activities, and by supporting and bringing awareness to their school program and collegiate pickleball in general."}

The three-day tournament featured big upsets, heated exchanges, and possibly the rowdiest crowd this sport has ever seen.\n\n‚Äç\n\nOn the first day, schools battled each other in group play. Out of the six schools in each of the six groups, only the top two would make it out of group play into the elimination round. Each group experienced intense competition and the upsets started on day one.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nNotable Upsets From Group Play:\n\nIn Group A #24 Virginia Tech upset #13 Kennesaw State and #12 Michigan.\nIn Group C #15 Ohio State upset #10 Grand Canyon University. Even after Ohio State‚Äôs starting male player dislocated his shoulder mid-match and they had to make an emergency substitution.\nIn Group D #16 Florida upset #4 Utah Valley and #9 Indiana.\nIn Group F #18 Maryland upset #6 Utah State.\n\nUVA's March To Victory\n\nOut of the 36 teams in the championship bracket, only 12 made it into the elimination bracket. Six of those teams earned a 5-0 record while only two teams, 1st seed Utah Tech and 7th seed Florida Atlantic, managed the impressive feat of not losing a single game during those five match wins.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhile there was hardly a shortage of great pickleball during group play, probably the most impressive story of the weekend was the oppressive campaign led by 5th seed UVA that had them dominating throughout the playoffs, toppling top teams left and right.\n\n‚Äç\n\nDuring the play-in round of the elimination bracket, UVA faced off against their Commonwealth rivals, Virginia Tech. During group play, 24th seed Virginia Tech had already pulled off the upsets against 13th seed Kennesaw State and 12th seed Michigan and was looking forward to taking down UVA. However, UVA had other plans for their in-state rivals and secured their place in the quarterfinals by beating Virginia Tech 3-1.\n\n‚Äç\n\nIn the quarterfinals, UVA faced off against the veteran team and 3rd seed TCU. After taking a big 2-0 lead on the Horned Frogs, the Hoos extended their run with a 3-1 win to advance to the semifinals.\n\n‚Äç\n\nSunday morning, the UNC Tarheels defeated the extremely tough team from Florida Atlantic. Their first-ever match loss for the championship after Florida Atlantic almost forced a dreambreaker. The second semifinal match positioned the number one seed and 2022 National Championship runner-up Utah Tech Trailblazers against the red-hot UVA squad.\n\n‚Äç\n\nUVA's Thrilling Victory Over the Undefeated Trailblazers\n\nThe Trailblazers came out with a 21-11 win in women‚Äôs doubles with a women‚Äôs team that hadn‚Äôt lost all tournament. The men‚Äôs doubles game saw UVA take a 6-1 lead, forcing Utah Tech to take an early time-out. The Trailblazers clawed back to take the late lead at 18-16, forcing UVA to take their time-out. With their composure regained, UVA stormed back to win 5 straight points to end the game 21-18 and tip the momentum back in their favor. The Trailblazers never recovered and UVA took the next two mixed games at 21-18 and 21-12, handing the previously 34-0 Utah Tech team their first loss of the year, and their second-ever loss in their program‚Äôs history.\n\n‚Äç\n\nWhile the win gave UVA much to celebrate, their job wasn‚Äôt over as they now had to battle the defending national champions, The UNC Tarheels. Both teams traveled well and the stands were packed with fans, players, and students donning either Carolina or Jefferson Blue. Before the match even started, the stadium echoed with school chants for both UNC and UVA. The crowd was roaring and the stage was set for what ended up being the most electric collegiate match in history.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nUVA's Unforgettable Journey to Claim the DUPR Collegiate National Championship Title\n\nUVA came out on fire, handing the UNC women their first loss of the tournament and taking a 1-0 lead on UNC. The men‚Äôs doubles game had an extremely close half, with the Tarheels leading at the side change 11-7. However, UNC showed why they were the defending champions, made the necessary adjustments, and held the UVA men to just 2 points in the second half to win 21-9. UNC capitalized on the momentum and took the first mixed game against UVA 21-14. UVA showed the same grit and determination that carried them to the finals in the first place and took an early six-point lead in the first half that UNC just couldn‚Äôt recover from. UVA finished the game 21-13, forcing the first-ever dreambreaker in Collegiate National Championship finals history.\n\n‚Äç\n\nUNC started the dreambreaker with a big 4-0 start against UVA. However, UVA battled back and their women in the 3rd and 4th dreambreaker spot, allowing UVA to trail by only one during the side changeover. UNC absolutely turned it on in the second half and found their rhythm. They marched on to a 20-16 lead and a championship point. Throughout the tournament, UVA proved time and time again that even when the odds are stacked against them, you can never count them out. Twice they defended UNC‚Äôs championship point, clawing their way to their own championship point, and ultimately stunning the Tarheels and winning the dreambreaker 23-21. Multiple times throughout the tournament, the Hoos defied the odds, battled back from deficits, and without a doubt, earned their crown as the new DUPR Collegiate National Champions.\n\n‚Äç\n\nThank you to everyone who came out to the event and a special thank you to all the teams, players, and all of our partners who helped make this event possible.\n\nThanks to our Partners\n\nLife Time - 2023 Collegiate Event Venue\nGAMMA - Official Paddle of Collegiate National Championships\nHEAD - Official Performance Footwear\nOOFOS - Official Recovery Footwear\nOSO Pickleball\nCirkul\nAnheuser-Busch\n\nVisit HERE for the full Collegiate National Championship Guide, including Brackets, Standing, and more!\n\n‚Äç"}

Today, Tres Palapas is the cornerstone of pickleball in Mexico and also the number one global destination for the sport.\n\nSince its opening, the resort has focused on promoting pickleball and has hosted numerous international junior tournaments. Throughout their years of operation, Tres Palapas has welcomed over half a million paying guests so far. The story of their dedication to the sport continues with DUPR.\n\n\nHow did you first get into pickleball?\n\n\"Twelve years ago I agreed to go for lessons and brought Sally with me. I personally learned pickleball by holding a paddle in my right hand and wearing flip-flops. After that two-hour lesson on bringing up stuff like ‚Äòthe kitchen‚Äô and ‚Äòthe dink‚Äô, we were thinking ‚Äòwhat is this?‚Äô That same night we ran to San Jose and bought running shoes,‚Äù said Paul.\n\nWhy did you decide to get so involved with pickleball and combine it with your resort?\n\n‚ÄúWe saw a need for a facility and we loved the game. Like I said, one of the reasons that made Tres Palapas what it has become is that we came from having no racquet experience of any kind and we built a place that we wanted to be at,‚Äù said Paul.\n\nWhat is unique about Tres Palapas?\n\n‚ÄúWe are different because we put pickleball first. We were built all around pickleball and it wasn't until this year that we actually opened rooms. There is so much more that you can have other than people coming to fill rooms. Other facilities are missing a huge part of the business. They are missing what you can bring to the community. Establishing a facility like Tres Palapas, has really refined how to be viable,‚Äù said Sally.\n\n\nHow important is the DUPR rating to you and your players?\n\n‚ÄúDUPR is getting very good recognition in the pickleball world. Now players are telling us, 'Here‚Äôs my DUPR,' and we get questioned if we use DUPR for registrations for our tournaments. Other than that, it's a huge motivator for the individuals who come in the door, and at the end of the day, it's great for the club because people have a greater investment in pickleball. Our players go from participating in events and clinics to becoming a greater part of the community,‚Äù said Paul.\n\nHow has the integration of the DUPR rating system contributed to the growth and development of players within your club?\n\n\"All that DUPR needs to know is the scores at the end of the game and who you were playing against. So being a resort, we've got our locals here, expats, as well as a lot of tourism. As an overall, we get a lot of different people coming in. It gives us a base to give people good quality play, especially for our round robins, our ladders, and leagues,‚Äù said Paul.\n\nHow has the pickleball space evolved since you started Tres Palapas?\n\n‚ÄúThe first international junior tournament, which at the time was the largest junior tournament ever held, took place here at Tres Palapas in 2018. Some of the kids that were in that tournament are now running their own facilities in Mexico. DUPR makes their jobs easier and more possible. It gives them a solid foundation of something that's reliable. San Jose, our little tiny airport here, receives 7 million visitors from the United States alone every year, and a lot of them play pickleball. They need places to play and DUPR is helping out,‚Äù said Sally.\n\nHow do you think DUPR will help Mexico when it comes to the growth of the sport?\n\n‚ÄúThe pickleball boom is on in Mexico. We're almost ten years into this now. We've had half a million paid entries through the gates. We have spawned so much pickleball in Mexico, and it's just at this point where it's starting to take off. You know, for us, we're the cornerstone in Mexico. Everybody still looks to us as to how they build their future. So hey, the next pickleball boom is right here. Mexico is it!‚Äù said Sally.\n\nDUPR has teamed up with Tres Palapas to offer a fantastic 4 days - 3 nights giveaway on our Instagram page!

Jade especially provided a great value pick for D.C. at 29 overall. Despite ranking 6th among MLP women on draft day, Jade was the 17th female drafted. A huge value, Jade increases her team's win probability by about 12 percent per match when compared to the typical 29th overall pick.\n\nSteal #2 - Hurricane Tyra Black: Drafted at 36th overall, right around her draft day doubles ranking. However, since the MLP draft, HTB has shot up the women's doubles rankings to number 12 among MLP women. This disparity between doubles rank and draft position yields about 11 percent win probability added per match.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\nChallenger Level Draft\n\nSteal #1 - Jaume Martinez Vich: Drafted at 44th overall, he is now the 5th-ranked men's doubles player in MLP Challenger. Given that their 4th round pick turned into the 5th overall men's doubles player in all of Challenger, it is not a surprise that Jaume's ascension yielded about 13 percent win probability added per match for the New York Hustlers.\n\nSteal #2 - Patrick Smith: Despite going undrafted, Patrick Smith is one of the biggest values in Challenger after serving as an injury replacement for Brandon French of the Seattle Pioneers. The addition of Patrick and his subsequent rise to the 4th highest-rated men's doubles player in Challenger provides a 17 percent win probability added per match for his team.\n\n‚Äç\n\nPlayer ranking is only relative to other MLP Players"}

Although he only started playing pickleball about two years ago, Kurt is passionate about growing pickleball in his community of Progreso, a port city on Mexico's Yucat√°n Peninsula, and promoting fair and equal play for all. After what was supposed to be a one year adventure, Kurt has never looked back and has spent the last 13 years in Mexico since moving from Canada.\n\n\n\n\nKurt had originally been introduced to pickleball by his friends from the Canadian city, Calgary because they wanted something to do while visiting him over the Christmas holiday. The story starts with Kurt‚Äôs long time friends ready and wanting to play, but the local groups would not let them participate because they were already over capacity with winter members. One of Kurt‚Äôs friends then said, ‚ÄúJust build me a court.‚Äù Kurt went on to measure his backyard parking area to see if a court would fit, and sure enough, it did. Then the Knights Court, named after the last name of his friends who requested it, came alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow important is the DUPR rating to you and your club?\n\n\n\n\nDUPR is so important to our club because it allows us to group our players six at a time with people of similar abilities. There is nothing more frustrating than having one player who does not fit in the right category because it ruins the game for everybody else. So, it really helps us sort out who belongs where.\n\n\n\n\nDo you think the DUPR rating helps motivate people?\n\n\n\n\nIt does for some people, and people are certainly driven by the rating. We would definitely like to see the latter come into effect.\n\n\n\n\nDo you have any significant milestones or goals that you would like to share?\n\n\n\n\nIn the next five to ten years, there will be a lot of growth in pickleball here in Mexico. I also think that when we get more people entering their scores into DUPR, that will be a big thing. If every game was put into DUPR, that would also be great.\n\n\n\n\nThe Knights Court is known for having a mural that spans the length of the court which includes paintings of all Kurt‚Äôs friends and family, comical pickleball sayings, the name of the court, and even a couple DUPR logos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúA local muralist did all of these. There are our three dogs, my niece, and my grandma. She also painted my wife and I. There are caricatures of everybody such as our parents, friends, and other family members,‚Äù said Kurt. His home offers six suites, which all have access to the court.\n\n\n\n\nAs Kurt said, ‚ÄúIn Mexico, people can have donkeys, chickens, or roosters living next door and there are no complaints.‚Äù But when the pickleball court opened, people complained, ‚ÄòWhy are people having so much fun at seven in the morning shouting and yelling?‚Äô Kurt then had to move his regularly scheduled pickleball games from the early morning to late evening.\n\n\n\n\nAs DUPR grows into different parts of the world, the organization is proud to have enthusiasts such as Kurt, who are passionate about pickleball, help grow the sport, and spread awareness about DUPR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Knights Court\n\nThe Knights Court is based in Progreso, Mexico, and was created to ensure a fun spot for all friends to play.

We spoke to founders and owner operators Stephen Conger and Michele Dabal about their amazing journey in pickleball.\n\nHow did you get started with Pickleball?\n\nIt‚Äôs a fairly unique story. I have been a liver transplant recipient for 18 years and they added pickleball as an event to the transplant games. A friend of mine, who I was playing tennis with at the transplant games lives in Florida, told me about this game called Pickleball. I said, ‚ÄòWhat in the world is that?‚Äô She said, ‚ÄòWhen I come back to New Jersey, I'll teach you how to play.‚Äô As soon as I started to play I fell quickly in love with the game and have been doing it ever since, said Michele.\nWhat inspired you to start a statewide pickleball league?\n\nWe love the league idea. From there, we talked to Tito at DUPR. He was excited to work with us and see how that could happen. The three of us met regularly and established the framework of the league. We then launched in the fall of 2022 with 66 teams. We thought it was pretty phenomenal; we were all over the state. Spring came along and we went up to 106 teams. We kept on getting more players and it was just unreal. So, I think in that regard it was kind of a seed that was planted and then we just kept watering it. Now it has grown into this fall where we have almost 120 teams, said Stephen.\n\nHow has DUPR played a role in all of this and why did you end up choosing DUPR?\n\nThe nice thing with DUPR is that it has data from everywhere. DUPR encapsulates more than just competitive tournament play. Now, it still doesn't capture everything. There's not a rating system out there that captures everything. But in terms of the data that's available, it has more. said Stephen.\n\nWhat is your most popular format?\n\nI think the league players are enjoying the more traditional play ‚Äî not rally scoring, regular scoring ‚Äî playing matches to 11, best out of three, because it's what they're accustomed to. But then when you go to Minor League pickleball, it bumps it up in the excitement level to be playing just like the Major League does. Initially people said, ‚ÄòWait, how do you do this? Where do I stand? Wait, we don't change sides?‚Äô But when they understand that, they are totally into it. It adds a special element to it where you are playing like the Major League pros, and you are at a really nice indoor facility and you just feel really good about the experience, said Michele.\n\nAbout All State Pickleball League:The statewide pickleball league in NJ features team based competition over a 10 week period. They have over 30 locations around the state that teams use both public and private, and they also run Minor League Pickleball events throughout New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.\n\nWe are proud to have All State Pickleball League a part of the DUPR family as they continue to grow and evolve their league and expand to more locations.

His unwavering passion for playing and instructing pickleball knows no geographical boundaries, as he firmly believes, \"If there‚Äôs a desire in the heart of veterans, we‚Äôll make it there.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGabe‚Äôs Quest to Find A New Purpose\n\n\n\n\nGabe George, a retired Navy corpsman, faced a life-altering motorcycle accident resulting in the paralysis of his right arm, which later needed amputation. In his quest to discover a new sense of purpose, Gabe's journey led him to the world of adaptive sports. It was through this path that he became acquainted with MACS, an organization that would become instrumental in developing his passion for pickleball. Gabe not only found fulfillment in playing the sport but also discovered his talent and love for teaching others the game.\n\n\n\n\nHumbling Pickleball Beginnings\n\n\n\n\nImmediately, Gabe fell in love with pickleball. He enjoyed how he could play several games and not feel beat up afterward. He got his start playing at a local church where he lives in Jacksonville, Florida. His opponents consisted of individuals in their seventies and eighties. Recalling his initial experience, Gabe humorously remarked, \"I had an eighty-four-year-old man stand in one spot and laugh while he whooped my butt and ran me around the whole court.\"\n\n\n\n\nSpreading the Pickleball Passion Through MACS\n\n\n\n\nMilitary Adaptive Court Sports is a phenomenal organization dedicated to teaching and promoting adaptive sports to disabled armed service members and veterans. Currently, their programs include pickleball, racquetball, and badminton, with plans to introduce padel tennis soon. All MACS instructors are certified and specially trained to work with individuals with disabilities.\n\n\n\n\nI‚Äôve had the honor of traveling all over the country teaching. I've taught hundreds and hundreds of veterans, able-bodied, and non-able-bodied people. It's my love. And when I'm not underwater diving or something, with my dog, or my daughter, I'm on the court somewhere.\n\n\n\n\nPickleball and DUPR: Ageless, Genderless, and for All Abilities\n\n\n\n\nPickleball aligns seamlessly with MACS due to its inclusivity.\n\n\n\n\nEverybody can play. You don't have to be a pro. I've taught kids, older folks, people who can barely walk, knee replacements, and people with visual impairments who can hear the different sounds and different balls. It‚Äôs very adaptive.\n\n\n\n\nThe DUPR rating system is beneficial in that it matches players up evenly based on skill level regardless of age, mobility, gender, and any other factors.\n\nIt‚Äôs very helpful. Once you play a while you can understand how the rating changes. And I love the growth of how the rating system has changed. It‚Äôs always updating, it‚Äôs really great for what we‚Äôve got going on right now. It‚Äôs helped get a judge of who you‚Äôre playing against. It‚Äôs not just about your age and your mobility, skill level is skill level. If you‚Äôre a master of your craft, it shouldn‚Äôt matter your age.\n\n\n\n\nMaking Their Way to Waterfall Nationals\n\n\n\n\nMACS and their director, Gabe, are making their way to the 2023 DUPR Waterfall Nationals in Rockwall, Texas, October 12-15. MACS will have a sports clinic each morning from 10 a.m. to noon.\n\n\n\n\nGabe enjoys the DUPR Waterfall format of four matches in four hours which means four times the fun.\n\n\n\n\nI love it because you get to play more. You get to mix with multiple different types of pickleball players and their different styles. I like what they‚Äôre doing with it, and I can see it being incorporated in a lot of other tournaments and events too.\n\n\n\n\nHe also mentioned the struggle that many of us have experienced with other tournament styles:\n\nYou‚Äôre sitting there and you've been waiting for hours and hours to play and just get to play that one game and then it's done. So, yeah, I think anytime it comes to a tournament when you‚Äôre guaranteed to get to play, that's going to light you up and make you want to be there more.\n\n‚Äç\n\n- ¬†-\n\nIf you're interested in learning more or participating in MACS, visit: Military Adaptive Court Sports.

It is easy to forget the need to refresh and have fun, especially as busy, working moms.\n\n\n\n\nTheir inspiring motto, ‚ÄúTry Harder,‚Äù applies to their daily routine with family, work, and pickleball. The two friends love traveling and competing against players of different backgrounds, ages, genders, and abilities.\n\n\n\n\nWith the DUPR Waterfall format, of four competitive matches all within a four-hour period, they've discovered how to make the most of their time and be able to play pickleball and still return to work or other commitments afterward.\n\n\n\n\nLiz and Emilie's friendship is a reminder that pickleball is a way to create memories, as well as build and maintain lasting friendships. They support each other, compete, and strengthen their bond on and off-court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you like the most about pickleball?\n\n\n\n\n\"The competition is fun, meeting different people from all over. We played in a bunch of different states. It has been a really fun adventure getting to see and meet new people,\" said Liz.\n\"You get your energy out; you get to do something where you lose yourself. We laugh every single time that we get out there, and we just have fun,\" said Emilie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow was your first experience playing at a Waterfall event?\n\n\n\n\n\"I like the quickness of it. There was not a lot of downtime, which was nice. We played four matches within an hour; that constant play was really beneficial. Even when we were not playing, they had courts reserved where we could warm up and continue to play. It was a really positive experience, \" said Liz.\n\n\n\n\n\"Also, when people would lose, they could play on the other courts. It is not like all of sudden you had to just leave, and you could still enjoy the whole experience of the Waterfall,\" said Emilie.\n\n\n\n\nWhat have you enjoyed most about the Waterfall format?\n\n\n\n\n\"The DUPR Waterfalls are great to be able to play, have fun, and be comfortable with yourself. I feel like it's not as much of a competition where people are shoving the ball down your throat and thinking they're better than you or you're better than me. And it moves quickly and it's fast which is a big deal, especially when you have to fit things into your busy schedule. We have our kids but we can still do things for ourselves,\" said Emilie.\n\n\n\n\n\"With these DUPR Waterfall tournaments, I was still able to go to work that afternoon after a morning tournament, so that's pretty awesome,\" said Liz.\n\n\n\n\nHow has the DUPR rating system enhanced your pickleball experience?\n\n\n\n\n\"I do like the idea that with DUPR, it's genderless and ageless. It really is strictly a rating. It gives more competition, especially when it is the two of us against two guys who are younger than us and look like they are in a lot better shape, but it is the rating system that keeps everything leveled, which is fun and makes us play better,\" said Liz.\n\n\n\n\nGrab a friend and sign up for Waterfall Nationals today. Make memories, enjoy some pickleball, and meet new people, all while playing for the chance to win 20,000+ in prize money. This is an opportunity you won't want to miss. Sign up today!

Chances are, you‚Äôre no match for Michael Cobb who has played 1420 games in one year, averaging 27 games per week.\n\n‚Äç\n\n\n\n\nAt 1400+ matches, you hold the record for most matches entered on DUPR, out of hundreds of thousands of users. When do you even sleep?\n\nI have a special situation here in Kansas City, as I've been the regional director of iPickle Nation for three and a half years now. We run Round Robins five days a week using the DUPR system. It's the best thing out there, because it helps us put people in the right levels. It just seems to create really good competitive games. We probably run 15,000 matches through DUPR in a year.\nWhenever the level is high enough, I play myself. That‚Äôs how I've been averaging 27 games a week, which is how I‚Äôve gotten 1420 matches entered in DUPR since August of 2022 ‚Äî so that's only little over a year‚Äôs worth. I don‚Äôt have a set goal I‚Äôm aiming for. As long as I can continue playing, I'll do it. ¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat got you hooked on pickleball?\n\nAbout four and a half years ago, I was at a community center working out in Kansas City, and I went to go get a drink at the water fountain and it was down below where the gymnasium was. I looked in there and saw people playing a weird game. There was a guy at the fountain, I asked him: ‚Äúwhat is that?‚Äù and he goes, ‚Äúit‚Äôs pickleball, you ought to try that sometime.‚Äù\nThe next day I was playing, and I've been hooked ever since. There‚Äôs a competitiveness to it, but you can play recreationally if you want to. That's the great thing about pickleball ‚Äî it‚Äôs an easy game for anybody to play, but to master it, there's a little more to it. And also the camaraderie. There's no discrimination on who can play this game. I also think it's going to keep elderly people living longer, honestly.\n\nWhat was your favorite match you ever entered?\n\nAbout two and a half years ago, we went to St Louis to qualify for the Nationals. My partner ‚Äî his name is Raven Pier ‚Äî does everything barefoot. It‚Äôs amazing. He walks out in the snow, barefoot. If it's 100 degrees out, it'll be barefoot. On the pickleball court, he‚Äôs barefoot. So the last match of the day, we had to win it to qualify, and it was an intense match. It probably lasted close to 40 minutes, with a lot of back and forth. I made some phenomenal plays, and so did he. We ended up winning 15-13, and we got to go to Nationals. That was definitely my best match that I can remember.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about the worst one ‚Äî the one you wish you could forget?\n\nThe worst match I remember goes hand in hand with the best: we went to nationals and got our butts smoked. It was in California, and they forced Raven to wear shoes. I told him the night before when we were practicing, ‚ÄúHey, Raven, let me give you a pair of socks‚Äù, knowing that playing barefoot with shoes might be hard on his feet. He said he‚Äôd be okay and played without socks. During practice, I noticed he wasn't moving as well, and usually he's a phenomenal player, so I knew something wasn't right. Well, after the matches were done and we had lost, he took off his shoes and he had bloody heels.\n\n\n\n\nHow do you feel about the changes to the DUPR rating algorithm?\n\nWhen they changed the algorithm, it seemed drastic. We went from like a chess type algorithm to strictly almost on wins and losses and it affected people. My community was asking me, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù and I had to explain you were just revamping the algorithm. But I do think it's a great system. Of course, there's going to be some tweaks to it that need to be done. If I'm not mistaken, there's wins and losses and the first type of algorithm being mixed together now, so it has definitely improved tremendously in the past months.\n\n\n\n\nWhich features would you want to see added to DUPR?\n\nIf there was a way to check in-depth stats for the last hundred games, or eventually, once you get enough data, you can bring up a player and get insight into your stats with that specific player.\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you say to players who complain about their DUPR rating?\n\n\n\n\n90% of players will think they're better than they are. I mean, that's just a given. And that‚Äôs ok, but it means they have trouble accepting their classification at first. I always tell them, you're just going to have to play and keep it going because the more games you get in, the more accurate it'll be.\n\n\n\n\nFull interview on YouTube: HERE\n\n\n\n\nCheck out Michael Cobb‚Äôs Profile: HERE"}
